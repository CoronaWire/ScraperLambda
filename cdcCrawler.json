Who is this for:  Healthcare personnel who may care for patients who are confirmed with or under investigation for COVID-19. What is it for:  This creates FAQs to support the existing  Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Guidance for COVID-19 . How is it used:  To assist healthcare facilities in preventing transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare settings. In general, transport and movement of the patient outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet. If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear all recommended PPE (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemaskif a respirator is not availableand eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown, gloves, and eye protection and perform hand hygiene. If the patient is wearing a facemask, no recommendation for PPE is made typically for HCP transporting patients with a respiratory infection from the patients room to the destination. However, given current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and following the currently cautious approach for risk stratification and monitoring of healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19 , use of a facemask by the transporter is recommended for anything more than brief encounters with COVID-19 patients. Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask). After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear all recommended PPE . If still wearing their original respirator or facemask, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States. Interim guidance for EMS personnel transporting patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is available here . EMS personnel should wear all recommended PPE because they are providing direct medical care and in close contact with the patient for longer periods of time. Standard Precautions should be followed when caring for any patient, regardless of suspected or confirmed COVID-19. If the patient is afebrile (temperature is less than 100.0 o F) and otherwise without even mild symptoms* that might be consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., cough, sore throat, shortness of breath), then precautions specific to COVID-19 are not required. However, until the patient is determined to be without such symptoms, HCP should wear all recommended PPE for the patient encounter. If the primary evaluation confirms the patient is without symptoms, management and need for any Transmission-Based Precautions should be based with the condition for which they are being evaluated (e.g., patient colonized with a drug-resistant organism), rather than potential exposure to COVID-19. This public health response is an important opportunity to reinforce the importance of strict adherence to Standard Precautions during all patient encounters. Standard Precautions are based on the principles that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions except sweat, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. The application of Standard Precautions is determined by the nature of the HCP-patient interaction and the extent of anticipated blood, body fluids, and pathogen exposure. For example, a facemask and eye protection should be worn during the care of any patient if splashes, sprays, or coughs could occur during the patient encounter. Similarly, gloves should be worn if contact with body fluids, mucous membranes, or nonintact skin are anticipated. *Note: In addition to cough and shortness of breath, nonspecific symptoms such as sore throat, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea have been noted as initial symptoms in some cases of COVID-19. These symptoms can have several alternative explanations; however, failure to identify and implement proper precautions in a healthcare setting for persons infected with COVID-19 can contribute to widespread transmission in that facility due to the presence of susceptible patients and close interactions with healthcare personnel. For this reason, a lower temperature of 100.0 o F and the inclusion of mild and non-specific symptoms should be used by healthcare settings evaluating these patients to increase the ability to detect even mild cases of COVID-19. In general, only essential personnel should enter the room of patients with COVID-19. Healthcare facilities should consider assigning daily cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to nursing personnel who will already be in the room providing care to the patient. If this responsibility is assigned to EVS personnel, they should wear all recommended PPE when in the room. PPE should be removed upon leaving the room, immediately followed by performance of hand hygiene. After discharge, terminal cleaning may be performed by EVS personnel. They should delay entry into the room until a sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. We do not yet know how long SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious in the air. Regardless, EVS personnel should refrain from entering the vacated room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles (more information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available). After this time has elapsed, EVS personnel may enter the room and should wear a gown and gloves when performing terminal cleaning. A facemask and eye protection should be added if splashes or sprays during cleaning and disinfection activities are anticipated or otherwise required based on the selected cleaning products. Shoe covers are not recommended at this time for personnel caring for patients with COVID-19. The collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from patients with known or suspected COVID-19 can be performed in a regular examination room with the door closed. Use of an airborne infection isolation room for nasopharyngeal specimen collection is not required. HCP in the room should wear an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown. If respirators are not readily available, they should be prioritized for other procedures at higher risk for producing infectious aerosols (e.g., intubation), instead of for collecting NP swabs. No. Updated  CDC  Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings  recommends placing patients in a regular examination room with the door closed. Airborne infection isolation rooms should be reserved for patients undergoing aerosol generating procedures or for diagnoses such as active tuberculosis. Although spread of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be primarily via respiratory droplets, the contribution of small respirable particles to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. Airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely. The amount of time that the air inside an examination room remains potentially infectious is not known and may depend on a number of factors including the size of the room, the number of air changes per hour, how long the patient was in the room, if the patient was coughing or sneezing, and if an aerosol-generating procedure was performed. Facilities will need to consider these factors when deciding when the vacated room can be entered by someone who is not wearing PPE. For a patient who was not coughing or sneezing, did not undergo an aerosol-generating procedure, and occupied the room for a short period of time (e.g., a few minutes), any risk to HCP and subsequent patients likely dissipates over a matter of minutes. However, for a patient who was coughing and remained in the room for a longer period of time or underwent an aerosol-generating procedure, the risk period is likely longer. For these higher risk scenarios, it is reasonable to apply a similar time period as that used for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, tuberculosis) and to restrict HCP and patients without PPE from entering the room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. General guidance on  clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions  is available. In addition to ensuring sufficient time for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles, HCP should clean and disinfect environmental surfaces and shared equipment before the room is used for another patient. CDC has released information about  strategies to optimize the supply of isolation gowns . Healthcare facilities should refer to that guidance and implement the recommended strategies to optimize their current supply of gowns. This includes shifting toward the use of washable cloth gowns, if feasible. The use of gowns as part of Contact Precautions in the context of MDROs has been implemented primarily to reduce the risk of transmission to other patients rather than to protect healthcare personnel (HCP). Facilities with shortages could consider suspending the use of gowns for the care of patients with endemic MDROs, such as MRSA, VRE, and ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacilli except as required for  Standard Precautions . Facilities should assess their local epidemiology to determine which MDROs are considered endemic. Regardless of the use of gowns, HCP at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. Hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. Facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an MDRO in a private room, if available. Caring for patients who have highly resistant Gram-negative organisms (e.g., carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacae) and other MDROs (e.g.,  Candida auris ) that are not considered endemic:  Rather than gowns being donned for every room entry, they should be reserved for use as part of  Standard Precautions and also prioritized for high-contact patient care activities that pose highest risk for transfer of pathogens from the patient to HCP. Examples of such high-contact care activities include dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use (central line, urinary catheter, feeding tube, tracheostomy/ventilator), and wound care. To further preserve gowns, HCP are recommended to bundle high-contact care activities as part of individual care encounters. Regardless of the use of gowns, HCP at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. Hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. Facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an MDRO in a private room, if available. Caring for patients with  Clostridioides difficile  infections (CDI):  Facilities should continue using Contact Precautions (putting on a gown and gloves upon entry into the patients room and placing the patient in a private room) for the care of symptomatic patients with CDI. As part of a  supplemental strategy to prevent transmission of CDI , some facilities have implemented Contact Precautions for the care of patients at high risk for CDI who have asymptomatic carriage of  Clostridioides difficile . There are limited data about the role of asymptomatic carriage in transmission of CDI. In this setting of a critical national shortage of gowns, facilities should consider suspending this approach until the shortage is addressed. Gowns should still be used as part of  Standard Precautions .

However, FFR decontamination and reuse may need to be considered as a crisis capacity strategy to ensure continued availability. Based on the limited research available, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, and moist heat showed the most promise as potential methods to decontaminate FFRs. This document summarizes research about decontamination of FFRs before reuse. Reusing disposable filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) has been suggested as a contingency capacity strategy to conserve available supplies for healthcare environments during a pandemic. Strategies for FFR extended use and reuse (without decontamination of the respirator) are currently available from  CDCs National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) . The surfaces of an FFR may become contaminated while filtering the inhalation air of the wearer during exposures to pathogen-laden aerosols. The pathogens on the filter materials of the FFR may be transferred to the wearer upon contact with the FFR during activities such as adjusting the FFR, improper doffing of the FFR, or when performing a user-seal check when redoffing a previously worn FFR. A study evaluating the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) on plastic, stainless steel, and carboard surfaces showed that the virus is able to survive for up to 72-hours [1]. One strategy to mitigate the contact transfer of pathogens from the FFR to the wearer during reuse is to issue five respirators to each healthcare worker who may care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The healthcare worker will wear one respirator each day and store it in a breathable paper bag at the end of each shift. The order of FFR use should be repeated with a minimum of five days between each FFR use. This will result in each worker requiring a minimum of five FFRs, providing that they put on, take off, care for them, and store them properly each day. Healthcare workers should treat the FFRs as though they are still contaminated and follow the precautions outlined in our reuse recommendations. If supplies are even more constrained and five respirators are not available for each worker who needs them, FFR decontamination may be necessary. Decontamination and subsequent reuse of FFRs should only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy. At present, FFRs are considered one time use and there are no manufacturer authorized methods for FFR decontamination prior to reuse. On March 28, 2020, FDA issued an  Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) permitting the Battelle Decontamination System external icon at Battelle Memorial Institute to be authorized for use in decontaminating compatible N95 respirators. The  FDA website external icon  should be checked to determine if other EUAs have been issued since the posting of this crisis capacity strategy guidance. Only respirator manufacturers can reliably provide guidance on how to decontaminate their specific models of FFRs. In absence of manufacturers recommendations, third parties may also provide guidance or procedures on how to decontaminate respirators without impacting respirator performance. Decontamination might cause poorer fit, filtration efficiency, and breathability of disposable FFRs as a result of changes to the filtering material, straps, nose bridge material, or strap attachments of the FFR.  CDC and NIOSH do not recommend that FFRs be decontaminated and then reused as standard care. This practice would be inconsistent with their approved use, but we understand in times of crisis, this option may need to be considered when FFR shortages exist.  An effective FFR decontamination method should reduce the pathogen burden, maintain the function of the FFR, and present no residual chemical hazard. The filter media in NIOSH-approved respirators varies by manufacturer. The ability of the respirator filter media to withstand cleaning and disinfection are not NIOSH performance requirements. The NIOSHs National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) and other researchers have investigated the impact of various decontamination methods on filtration efficiency, facepiece fit of FFRs, and the ability to reduce viable virus or bacteria on the FFRs. This research is summarized below. Because ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP), and moist heat showed the most promise as potential methods to decontaminate FFRs, researchers, decontamination companies, healthcare systems, or individual hospitals should focus current efforts on these technologies. Specifically, the effectiveness of using these methods should be explored further with specific FFR models based on the manufacturers support to better understand the impact on the respirator performance, including filtration and fit. The respirator manufacturer should be consulted about the impact of the method on their respirators prior to considering the use of any method. When information from the manufacturer or a third-party is available showing that respirators can be successfully decontaminated without impacting respirator performance, then FFRs decontaminated following those recommendations can be worn for any patient care activities. In the absence of guidance or when information is available that a respirator cannot be decontaminated without negatively impacting the performance, respirators may still be decontaminated. However, given the uncertainties on the impact of decontamination on respirator performance, these FFRs should not be worn by HCPs when performing or present for an aerosol-generating procedure. No current data exists supporting the effectiveness of these decontamination methods specifically against SARS-CoV-2 on an FFR. Other pathogens may also be present on FFRs and there is only limited data available for other pathogens. Further work is needed to assure SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens are inactivated. Therefore, even after decontamination, these FFRs should be handled carefully. HCPs should take the following precautionary measures prior to using a decontaminated FFR: Table 1 provides a summary of the crisis standards of care decontamination recommendations.

Table 3. Summary of decontamination method antimicrobial efficacy T1, T7, and phi-6 bacteriophages Vaporous hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, and moist heat are the most promising decontamination methods. If FFR decontamination is considered, these methods do not appear to break down filtration or compromise the FFR; however, many of these methods can only be used for limited times. Investigations into VHP decontamination of FFRs provides evidence of minimal effect to filtration and fit while demonstrating 99.9999% efficiency in killing bacterial spores. VHP did not reduce the filtration performance of the ten N95 FFR models tested while showing a 6-log reduction in  Geobacillus stearothermophilus  spores [2-4]. In a report prepared by Battelle Memorial Institute, the 3M 1860 FFR was shown to maintain filtration performance for 50 treatment cycles of VHP, also referred to as HPV by some decontamination system manufacturers, using the Clarus   R HPV generator form Bioquell (utilizing 30% H 2 O 2 ). Additionally, FFR fit was shown to be unaffected for up to 20 VHP treatments cycles using NPPTLs Static Advanced Headform [4, 5]. Strap degradation occurred after 20 treatment cycles. Kenney et al., co-contaminated 3M 1870 FFRs with three bacteriophages, T1, T7, and Phi 6, and decontaminated the FFRs using VHP generated from the Bioquells BQ-50 system. The VHP treatment was shown inactivate >99.999% of all phages which was below the limit of detection [6]. Viscusi et al. found that 9 FFR models (three particulate N95, three surgical N95 FFRs and three P100) exposed to one cycle of VHP treatment using the STERRAD 100S H 2 O 2  Gas Plasma Sterilizer (Advanced Sterilization Products, Irvine, CA) had filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance levels similar to untreated models; however, Bergman et al. found that three cycles of VHP treatment using the STERRAD 100S H 2 O 2  Gas Plasma Sterilizer negatively affected filtration performance [2, 3]. Bergman et al. measured acceptable filtration performance for six FFR models (three particulate and three surgical FFRs) that received three cycles of VHP treatment using the Clarus   R HPV generator (utilizing 30% H 2 O 2 ) [3]. VHP is a promising method with a potential for high capacity throughput, but certain VHP systems, such as the Clarus   R HPV generator, may be more compatible with FFR decontamination. UVGI is a promising method but the disinfection efficacy is dependent on dose. Not all UV lamps provide the same intensity thus treatment times would have to be adjusted accordingly. Moreover, UVGI is unlikely to kill all the viruses and bacteria on an FFR due to shadow effects produced by the multiple layers of the FFRs construction. Acceptable filtration performance was recorded for eleven FFR models exposed to various UV doses ranging from roughly 0.5950 J/cm 2  and UVGI was shown to have minimal effect on fit [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Heimbuch et al. tested filtration and fit of 15 FFRs and found no adverse effects to FFR performance [11]. Lindsley et al. reported a reduction of the durability of materials of the FFRs for doses ranging from 120950 J/cm 2 ; however, an approximate inactivation of 99.9% of bacteriophage MS2, a non-enveloped virus, and H1N1 influenza A/PR/8/34 were achieved with much lower doses of approximately 1 J/cm 2  [1214]. Heimbuch et al. tested the performance of 1 J/cm 2  of UVGI against Influenza A (H1N1), Avian influenza A virus (H5N1), Influenza A (H7N9) A/Anhui/1/2013, Influenza A (H7N9) A/Shanghai/1/2013, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV and reported virus inactivation from 99.9% to greater than 99.999% [11]. UVGI is harmful. Proper precautions are required to avoid UVGI exposure to skin or the eyes. Moist heat, consisting of 60C and 80% RH caused minimal degradation in the filtration and fit performance of the tested FFRs [3, 9, 10]. Heimbuch et al. disinfected FFRs contaminated with H1N1 using moist heat, of 65C and 85% RH, and achieved a minimal of 99.99% reduction in virus [14]. One limitation of the moist heat method is the uncertainty of the disinfection efficacy for various pathogens. Steam treatment may be a suitable approach for decontaminating FFRs. The limited number of studies for steam report minimal effect on FFR filtration and fit performance and a minimum 99.9% reduction in H1N1 and bacteriophage MS2 [14, 15]. Fisher et al. used microwave steam bags, designed for disinfecting infant feeding equipment, to decontaminate six FFR models and achieved 99.9% inactivation of MS2 bacteriophage. Filtration performance of all tested FFRs scored above NIOSH certification requirements. Three FFRs were further evaluated for three cycles of steam exposure and demonstrated no change in filtration performance [15]. Bergman et al. also demonstrated acceptable filtration performance after three cycles of exposure to microwave generated steam [3]. Microwave generated steam had little effect on FFR fit after exposure to up to three cycles of steam [9, 10]. Using microwaves to produce steam to decontaminate FFRs is not without limitations. Not all microwaves are constructed the same and some are more powerful than others. The effect of higher power microwaves on FFRs is unknown. Furthermore, the metal nosebands of FFRs may cause arcing, sparks inside the microwave oven, during exposure to microwaves. Liquid hydrogen peroxide showed no effect of FFR filtration performance [3, 7]. Bergman et al. evaluated six FFRs for filtration performance after a 30-minute submersion in 6% hydrogen peroxide. All six FFR models tested demonstrated no changes in filter performance after three cycles of decontamination. FFR fit and disinfection efficacy were not assessed for this method. Vaporous hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, and moist heat are the most promising decontamination methods. If FFR decontamination is considered, these methods do not appear to break down filtration or compromise the FFR; however, many of these methods can only be used for limited times.

All six FFR models tested demonstrated no changes in filter performance after three cycles of decontamination. FFR fit and disinfection efficacy were not assessed for this method. Table 4 provides a summary of the decontamination methods evaluated for each FFR model. Table 4. Decontamination methods evaluated for each FFR model Table 4 provides a summary of the decontamination methods evaluated for each FFR model. Table 4. Decontamination methods evaluated for each FFR model Autoclaving and the use of disinfectant wipes are not recommended as crisis strategies as they may alter FFR performance. Decontamination using an autoclave, 160C dry heat, 70% isopropyl alcohol, microwave irradiation and soap and water caused significant filter degradation to both FFRs and particle penetration levels did not meet the levels that NIOSH would allow for approval. Decontamination with bleach caused slight degradation in filtration performance and created an odor that would not be suitable for use [2, 7]. Heimbuch et al. evaluated biological decontamination efficacy and filtration penetration following aerosol exposure of mucin or viable  Staphylococcus aureus  [18]. Following aerosol exposure, respirators were cleaned with three types of wipes: hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride (BAC), or nonantimicrobial. Particle penetration following cleaning yielded mean values <5%. The highest penetrations were observed in FFRs cleaned with BAC wipes. The BAC wipe caused one sample of FFRs to exceed 5% penetration. Filter penetration following various decontamination methods was shown in this study to vary based on the decontamination method and the model of FFR. Ethylene oxide is not recommended as a crisis strategy as it may be harmful to the wearer. Ethylene oxide (EtO) was shown to not harm filtration performance for the nine tested FFR models [2, 3, 7]. All tests were conducted for one hour at 55C with EtO gas concentrations ranging from 725 to 833 g/L. Six models that were exposed to three cycles of 736 mg/L EtO all passed the filtration performance assessment [3]. Data is not available for the effect that EtO treatment may have on FFR fit. However, EtO treatment does not cause visible physical changes to the appearance of FFRs [2, 3]. A serious concern about using EtO for decontamination of large numbers of FFRs is throughput, since relatively long aeration cycles are needed to ensure removal of highly toxic EtO gas [2]. Any use of ethylene oxide (EtO) should be accompanied by studies to ensure no off-gassing into the breathing zone of the wearer as EtO is carcinogenic and teratogenic. Chronic inhalation of EtO has been linked to neurologic dysfunction and may cause other harmful effects to the wearer [16]. EtO should be used in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard 29 CFR 1910.1047 [17]. Hospitals may have other decontamination capabilities on-hand that may be feasible. For example, photodynamic inactivation of pathogens using methylene blue plus visible light exposure is used to treat blood products and there is interest in using the method to decontaminate PPE. There is currently no data to evaluate the effect of this method on FFR filtration and fit [19]. Autoclaving and the use of disinfectant wipes are not recommended as crisis strategies as they may alter FFR performance. Decontamination using an autoclave, 160C dry heat, 70% isopropyl alcohol, microwave irradiation and soap and water caused significant filter degradation to both FFRs and particle penetration levels did not meet the levels that NIOSH would allow for approval.

Six models that were exposed to three cycles of 736 mg/L EtO all passed the filtration performance assessment [3]. Data is not available for the effect that EtO treatment may have on FFR fit. However, EtO treatment does not cause visible physical changes to the appearance of FFRs [2, 3]. A serious concern about using EtO for decontamination of large numbers of FFRs is throughput, since relatively long aeration cycles are needed to ensure removal of highly toxic EtO gas [2]. Any use of ethylene oxide (EtO) should be accompanied by studies to ensure no off-gassing into the breathing zone of the wearer as EtO is carcinogenic and teratogenic. Chronic inhalation of EtO has been linked to neurologic dysfunction and may cause other harmful effects to the wearer [16]. EtO should be used in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard 29 CFR 1910.1047 [17]. Hospitals may have other decontamination capabilities on-hand that may be feasible. For example, photodynamic inactivation of pathogens using methylene blue plus visible light exposure is used to treat blood products and there is interest in using the method to decontaminate PPE. There is currently no data to evaluate the effect of this method on FFR filtration and fit [19]. Lowe, J.J.

Timely communication between clinical and laboratory staff is essential to minimize the risk incurred in handling specimens from patients with possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such specimens should be labeled accordingly, and the laboratory should be alerted to ensure proper specimen handling. General and specific biosafety guidelines for handling SARS-CoV-2 specimens are provided below. For additional information on handling SARS-CoV-2 specimens, refer to the  Laboratory Biosafety Frequently Asked Questions . All laboratories should perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks. Risk assessments and mitigation measures are dependent on: Follow Standard Precautions when handling clinical specimens, all of which may contain potentially infectious materials. Standard Precautions include hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, and eye protection. Follow routine laboratory practices and procedures for decontamination of work surfaces and management of laboratory waste. Routine diagnostic testing of specimens, such as the following activities, can be handled in a BSL-2 laboratory using Standard Precautions: For diagnostic testing of specimens conducted outside of a BSL-2 laboratory, such as rapid respiratory testing performed at the point of care, use Standard Precautions to provide a barrier between the specimen and personnel during specimen manipulation. For additional information on specimen collection, handling, and testing refer to Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons Under Investigation (PUIs) . For procedures with a high likelihood to generate aerosols or droplets, use either a certified Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) or additional precautions to provide a barrier between the specimen and personnel. Examples of these additional precautions include personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a surgical mask or face shield, or other physical barriers, like a splash shield; centrifuge safety cups; and sealed centrifuge rotors to reduce the risk of exposure to laboratory personnel. Site- and activity-specific biosafety risk assessments should be performed to determine if additional biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols. Procedures that concentrate viruses, such as precipitation or membrane filtration, can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory with unidirectional airflow and BSL-3 precautions, including respiratory protection and a designated area for donning and doffing PPE. The donning and doffing space should not be in the workspace. Work should be performed in a certified Class II BSC. This guidance is intended for only those laboratories that perform virus concentration procedures, such as wastewater/sewage surveillance testing, not public health or clinical diagnostic laboratories that handle COVID-19 clinical specimens or laboratories that perform culture and isolation of SARS-CoV-2. Site- and activity-specific biosafety risk assessments should be performed to determine if additional biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes or large volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols. Virus isolation in cell culture and initial characterization of viral agents recovered in cultures of SARS-CoV-2 specimens should only be conducted in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory using BSL-3 practices. Site- and activity-specific biosafety risk assessments should be performed to determine if additional biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs. Decontaminate work surfaces and equipment with appropriate disinfectants. Use EPA-registered hospital disinfectants with label claims to be effective against  SARS-CoV-2 external icon . Follow manufacturers recommendations for use, such as dilution, contact time, and safe handling. Handle laboratory waste from testing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient specimens as all other biohazardous waste in the laboratory. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that this laboratory waste needs any additional packaging or disinfection procedures Pack and ship suspected and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patient specimens, cultures, or isolates as UN 3373 Biological Substance, Category B, in accordance with the current edition of the  International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations external icon .

It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will be identified in more communities, including areas where cases have not yet been reported. As such, nursing homes should assume it could already be in their community and move to restrict all visitors and unnecessary HCP from the facility; cancel group activities and communal dining; and implement active screening of residents and HCP for fever and respiratory symptoms.

As such, nursing homes should assume it could already be in their community and move to restrict all visitors and unnecessary HCP from the facility; cancel group activities and communal dining; and implement active screening of residents and HCP for fever and respiratory symptoms. Given their congregate nature and residents served (e.g., older adults often with underlying chronic medical conditions), nursing home populations are at the highest risk of being affected by COVID-19. If infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, residents are at increased risk of serious illness. Visitor Restrictions \nIll visitors and healthcare personnel (HCP) are the most likely sources of introduction of COVID-19 into a facility. CDC recommends aggressive visitor restrictions and enforcing sick leave policies for ill HCP, even before COVID-19 is identified in a community or facility. These recommendations supplement  CDCs  Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings . These recommendations are specific for nursing homes, including skilled nursing facilities. Much of this information could also be applied in assisted living facilities. This information complements, but does not replace, the general  infection prevention and control recommendations  for COVID-19. This guidance is based on the currently available information about COVID-19. It will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States. It is important to understand transmission dynamics in your community to inform strategies to prevent introduction or spread of COVID-19 in your facility. Consultation with public health authorities can help you better understand if transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in your community.

When to End Transmission-Based Precautions Refer to the  Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 . Resources for Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19 Given their congregate nature and residents served (e.g., older adults often with underlying chronic medical conditions), nursing home populations are at the highest risk of being affected by COVID-19. If infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, residents are at increased risk of serious illness. Visitor Restrictions \nIll visitors and healthcare personnel (HCP) are the most likely sources of introduction of COVID-19 into a facility. CDC recommends aggressive visitor restrictions and enforcing sick leave policies for ill HCP, even before COVID-19 is identified in a community or facility. These recommendations supplement  CDCs  Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings . These recommendations are specific for nursing homes, including skilled nursing facilities. Much of this information could also be applied in assisted living facilities. This information complements, but does not replace, the general  infection prevention and control recommendations  for COVID-19. This guidance is based on the currently available information about COVID-19. It will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States.

Here is what is currently known: This guidance is applicable to all U.S. healthcare settings. This guidance is not intended for non-healthcare settings (e.g., schools) OR for persons outside of healthcare settings. For recommendations regarding clinical management, air or ground medical transport, or laboratory settings, refer to the main CDC  COVID-19 website . Mode of transmission:  Early reports suggest person-to-person transmission most commonly happens during close exposure to a person infected with COVID-19, primarily via respiratory droplets produced when the infected person coughs or sneezes. Droplets can land in the mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs of those within close proximity. The contribution of small respirable particles, sometimes called aerosols or droplet nuclei, to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. However, airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely. Shortage of personal protective equipment: Controlling exposures to occupational infections is a fundamental method of protecting HCP. Traditionally, a hierarchy of controls has been used as a means of determining how to implement feasible and effective control solutions. The hierarchy ranks controls according to their reliability and effectiveness and includes such controls as engineering controls, administrative controls, and ends with personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE is the least effective control because it involves a high level of worker involvement and is highly dependent on proper fit and correct, consistent use. Major distributors in the United States have reported shortages of PPE, specifically N95 respirators, facemasks, and gowns. Healthcare facilities are responsible for protecting their HCP from exposure to pathogens, including by providing appropriate PPE. In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible.Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella). The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about  strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators , including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a  companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.

The latest situation summary updates are available on CDCs web page  Coronavirus Disease 2019 . This document provides guidance for ships originating from, or stopping in, the United States to help prevent, detect, and medically manage suspected COVID-19 infections. As ships travel worldwide, ship management and medical staff need to be aware and respond to local jurisdictional requirements. A patients travel and exposure history, clinical presentation, and underlying medical conditions are essential in the assessment and decision-making process for patients who may need for further medical evaluation, testing, and treatment. This document provides guidance for preventing spread of COVID-19 during and after a voyage, including personal protective measures for crew members. CDC will update this interim guidance to ships as needed and as additional information becomes available. Commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, involves the movement of large numbers of people in closed and semi-closed settings. Like other close-contact environments, ships may facilitate transmission of respiratory viruses from person to person through exposure to respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces. To reduce spread of respiratory infections including COVID-19, CDC recommends that ships encourage crew members and passengers to Identifying and isolating passengers and crew with possible symptoms of COVID-19 as soon as possible is needed to minimize transmission of this virus. Cruise ship medical personnel and telemedicine providers should reference CDCs COVID-19 website  Information Healthcare Professionals  for the latest information on infection control, clinical management, collecting clinical specimens, and evaluating patients who may be sick with or who have been exposed to COVID-19. Symptoms may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Patients have a fever if they feel warm to the touch, give a history of feeling feverish, or have a measured temperature of 100.4F (38C) or higher. COVID-19 infections have ranged from little-to-no symptoms to severe illness and death. The  incubation period is believed to be 214 days . Cruise ship medical staff and telemedicine providers evaluating patients with fever or acute respiratory illness should obtain a detailed travel history and assess for any other potential exposures to a person with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Although routes of transmission have yet to be definitively determined, CDC recommends a cautious approach to interacting with patients under investigation. Deny boarding of a passenger or crew member who is suspected to have COVID-19 infection based on signs and symptoms plus travel history in China or other known exposure at the time of embarkation. Isolate passengers or crew onboard who are suspected of having COVID-19 infection in a single-occupancy cabin with the door closed until symptoms are improved. Discontinuing isolation precautions is made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with CDC. Ideally, medical follow-up should occur in the isolated persons cabin. Coordinate visits to the onboard medical center in advance, if needed, with medical staff. Have the sick person  wear a facemask  before leaving their cabin. Refer to  CDC guidance  for information about assessing exposure risk and recommended public health management. CDC is available for consultation on risk assessment and management of exposed passengers and crew. For consultation, contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or  eocreport@cdc.gov . Passengers and crew members who have had high-risk exposures to a person suspected of having COVID-19 should be quarantined in their cabins. All potentially exposed passengers, cruise ship medical staff, and crew members should self-monitor under supervision of ship medical staff or telemedicine providers until 14 days after the last possible exposure. Ensure your crew members are aware of the The ships company should also review their sick leave polices and communicate them to employees. CDC recommends that crew members who self-report or appear to have fever or acute respiratory symptoms (such as cough or shortness of breath) be immediately evaluated. In addition to annual influenza vaccination, have crew members follow these recommendations when their work activities involve contact with passengers and other crew members who have fever or acute respiratory illness. CDC requires  that ships destined for a US port of entry immediately report any death onboard or illness that meets CDCs definition of ill person, including suspected cases of COVID-19, to the  CDC Quarantine Station with jurisdiction for the port. Additional information for non-cruise ships:   :  If the signs and symptoms are consistent with CDCs standard  required reporting  requirements, please have the following information available before notifying the nearest  CDC Quarantine Station : For ships on international voyages, if an illness occurred on board, complete the Maritime Declaration of Health and send to the competent authority, according to the 2005 International Health Regulations and the national legislation of the country of disembarkation. To consult CDC about assessing exposure risk and identifying contacts of ill travelers and crew, clinical management, laboratory specimen collection, or infection control concerns related to COVID-19, contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or  eocreport@cdc.gov . Before arriving at a US port, vessel medical staff and telemedicine providers or a cruise line representative must discuss the disembarkation of patients suspected of having COVID-19 with the  CDC Quarantine Station having jurisdiction for the port and with the state and local health departments. CDC quarantine officials can help communicate with state and local health departments and will work with the ships company, port partners, and health departments to ensure safe disembarkation and medical transportation of the patient upon arrival. Instruct crew members and other staff who may have contact with persons suspected of having COVID-19 in the proper storage, use (including  safe donning and doffing  pdf icon [PDF  3 pages] ), and disposal of PPE. Wrong use or handling of PPE can increase spread of disease. Ships should ensure availability of conveniently located dispensers of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Where sinks are available, ensure handwashing supplies (such as soap, disposable towels) are consistently available. Ships should carry a sufficient quantity of These optimal recommendations can be modified to reflect individual ship capabilities and characteristics. At this time, in addition to routine cleaning and disinfection strategies, ships may consider more frequent cleaning of commonly touched surfaces such as handrails, countertops, and doorknobs. The primary mode of COVID-19 virus transmission is believed to be through respiratory droplets that are spread from an infected person through coughing or sneezing to a susceptible close contact within about 6 feet. Therefore, widespread disinfection is unlikely to be effective. Cleaning recommendations are based on existing  CDC infection control guidance  for preventing COVID-19 from spreading to others in homes. Standard practice for pathogens spread by air (such as measles, tuberculosis) is to restrict people unprotected (for example, no respiratory protection) from entering a vacated room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles (more information on  clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available). We dont yet know how long COVID-19 remains infectious in the air. In the interim, it is reasonable to apply a similar time period before entering the sick persons room without respiratory protection as used for other pathogens spread by air (for example, measles, tuberculosis).  Using measles as the example  pdf icon [PDF  13 pages] , restrict access for two hours after the sick person has left the room. Clean surfaces infected by the respiratory secretions of a sick person suspected with COVID-19 (for example, in the sick persons living quarters or work area, and in isolation rooms). Use disinfectant products against COVID-19 with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved emerging viral pathogens claims. These products can be identified by the following claim: This claim or a similar claim, will be made only through the following communications outlets: technical literature distributed exclusively to healthcare facilities, physicians, nurses, and public health officials, 1-800 consumer information services, social media sites and company websites (non-label related). In addition to wearing disposable gloves during routine cleaning, wear disposable gowns when cleaning areas suspected to be contaminated by COVID-19. Wear PPE compatible with the disinfectant products being used and approved for use onboard the ship.  Remove carefully  pdf icon [PDF  1 page] gloves and gowns to avoid cross-contamination and the surrounding area. Perform  hand hygiene upon removing and disposing gloves by washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol. Clean all high-touch surfaces in the sick persons room (for example, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, light switches, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables) according to instructions described for the above EPA-registered product. Wear disposable gloves and gowns during cleaning activities. If visible contamination (for example, blood, respiratory secretions, or other body fluids) is present, the basic principles for blood or body substance spill management are outlined in the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  Bloodborne Pathogen Standard external icon . CDC guidelines recommend removing bulk spill matter, cleaning the site, and then disinfecting the site with the above EPA-registered disinfectant. For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present, and wash according to the manufacturers instructions. Clean and disinfect unremovable materials with products mentioned above and allow to air dry. When cleaning is completed, collect soiled textiles and linens in sturdy leak-proof containers; these can be laundered using conventional processes following your standard operating procedures.PPE should be removed and placed with other disposable items in sturdy, leak-proof (plastic) bags that are tied shut and not reopened.The bags of used PPE and disposable items can then be placed intothe solid waste stream according to routine procedures. Follow your standard operating procedures for waste removal and treatment. No additional cleaning is needed for the ships supply-and-return ventilation registers or filtration systems. No additional treatment of wastewater is needed.

Cruise ship medical personnel and telemedicine providers should reference CDCs COVID-19 website  Information Healthcare Professionals  for the latest information on infection control, clinical management, collecting clinical specimens, and evaluating patients who may be sick with or who have been exposed to COVID-19. Symptoms may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Patients have a fever if they feel warm to the touch, give a history of feeling feverish, or have a measured temperature of 100.4F (38C) or higher. COVID-19 infections have ranged from little-to-no symptoms to severe illness and death. The  incubation period is believed to be 214 days . Cruise ship medical staff and telemedicine providers evaluating patients with fever or acute respiratory illness should obtain a detailed travel history and assess for any other potential exposures to a person with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Although routes of transmission have yet to be definitively determined, CDC recommends a cautious approach to interacting with patients under investigation. Deny boarding of a passenger or crew member who is suspected to have COVID-19 infection based on signs and symptoms plus travel history in China or other known exposure at the time of embarkation. Isolate passengers or crew onboard who are suspected of having COVID-19 infection in a single-occupancy cabin with the door closed until symptoms are improved. Discontinuing isolation precautions is made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with CDC. Ideally, medical follow-up should occur in the isolated persons cabin. Coordinate visits to the onboard medical center in advance, if needed, with medical staff. Have the sick person  wear a facemask  before leaving their cabin. Refer to  CDC guidance  for information about assessing exposure risk and recommended public health management. CDC is available for consultation on risk assessment and management of exposed passengers and crew. For consultation, contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or  eocreport@cdc.gov . Passengers and crew members who have had high-risk exposures to a person suspected of having COVID-19 should be quarantined in their cabins. All potentially exposed passengers, cruise ship medical staff, and crew members should self-monitor under supervision of ship medical staff or telemedicine providers until 14 days after the last possible exposure. Ensure your crew members are aware of the The ships company should also review their sick leave polices and communicate them to employees. CDC recommends that crew members who self-report or appear to have fever or acute respiratory symptoms (such as cough or shortness of breath) be immediately evaluated. In addition to annual influenza vaccination, have crew members follow these recommendations when their work activities involve contact with passengers and other crew members who have fever or acute respiratory illness. CDC requires  that ships destined for a US port of entry immediately report any death onboard or illness that meets CDCs definition of ill person, including suspected cases of COVID-19, to the  CDC Quarantine Station with jurisdiction for the port. Additional information for non-cruise ships:   :  If the signs and symptoms are consistent with CDCs standard  required reporting  requirements, please have the following information available before notifying the nearest  CDC Quarantine Station : For ships on international voyages, if an illness occurred on board, complete the Maritime Declaration of Health and send to the competent authority, according to the 2005 International Health Regulations and the national legislation of the country of disembarkation. To consult CDC about assessing exposure risk and identifying contacts of ill travelers and crew, clinical management, laboratory specimen collection, or infection control concerns related to COVID-19, contact the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or  eocreport@cdc.gov . Before arriving at a US port, vessel medical staff and telemedicine providers or a cruise line representative must discuss the disembarkation of patients suspected of having COVID-19 with the  CDC Quarantine Station having jurisdiction for the port and with the state and local health departments. CDC quarantine officials can help communicate with state and local health departments and will work with the ships company, port partners, and health departments to ensure safe disembarkation and medical transportation of the patient upon arrival. Instruct crew members and other staff who may have contact with persons suspected of having COVID-19 in the proper storage, use (including  safe donning and doffing  pdf icon [PDF  3 pages] ), and disposal of PPE. Wrong use or handling of PPE can increase spread of disease. Ships should ensure availability of conveniently located dispensers of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Where sinks are available, ensure handwashing supplies (such as soap, disposable towels) are consistently available. Ships should carry a sufficient quantity of These optimal recommendations can be modified to reflect individual ship capabilities and characteristics. At this time, in addition to routine cleaning and disinfection strategies, ships may consider more frequent cleaning of commonly touched surfaces such as handrails, countertops, and doorknobs. The primary mode of COVID-19 virus transmission is believed to be through respiratory droplets that are spread from an infected person through coughing or sneezing to a susceptible close contact within about 6 feet. Therefore, widespread disinfection is unlikely to be effective. Cleaning recommendations are based on existing  CDC infection control guidance  for preventing COVID-19 from spreading to others in homes. Standard practice for pathogens spread by air (such as measles, tuberculosis) is to restrict people unprotected (for example, no respiratory protection) from entering a vacated room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles (more information on  clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available). We dont yet know how long COVID-19 remains infectious in the air. In the interim, it is reasonable to apply a similar time period before entering the sick persons room without respiratory protection as used for other pathogens spread by air (for example, measles, tuberculosis).  Using measles as the example  pdf icon [PDF  13 pages] , restrict access for two hours after the sick person has left the room. Clean surfaces infected by the respiratory secretions of a sick person suspected with COVID-19 (for example, in the sick persons living quarters or work area, and in isolation rooms). Use disinfectant products against COVID-19 with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved emerging viral pathogens claims. These products can be identified by the following claim: This claim or a similar claim, will be made only through the following communications outlets: technical literature distributed exclusively to healthcare facilities, physicians, nurses, and public health officials, 1-800 consumer information services, social media sites and company websites (non-label related). In addition to wearing disposable gloves during routine cleaning, wear disposable gowns when cleaning areas suspected to be contaminated by COVID-19. Wear PPE compatible with the disinfectant products being used and approved for use onboard the ship.  Remove carefully  pdf icon [PDF  1 page] gloves and gowns to avoid cross-contamination and the surrounding area. Perform  hand hygiene upon removing and disposing gloves by washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol. Clean all high-touch surfaces in the sick persons room (for example, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, light switches, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables) according to instructions described for the above EPA-registered product. Wear disposable gloves and gowns during cleaning activities. If visible contamination (for example, blood, respiratory secretions, or other body fluids) is present, the basic principles for blood or body substance spill management are outlined in the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  Bloodborne Pathogen Standard external icon . CDC guidelines recommend removing bulk spill matter, cleaning the site, and then disinfecting the site with the above EPA-registered disinfectant. For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present, and wash according to the manufacturers instructions. Clean and disinfect unremovable materials with products mentioned above and allow to air dry. When cleaning is completed, collect soiled textiles and linens in sturdy leak-proof containers; these can be laundered using conventional processes following your standard operating procedures.PPE should be removed and placed with other disposable items in sturdy, leak-proof (plastic) bags that are tied shut and not reopened.The bags of used PPE and disposable items can then be placed intothe solid waste stream according to routine procedures. Follow your standard operating procedures for waste removal and treatment. No additional cleaning is needed for the ships supply-and-return ventilation registers or filtration systems. No additional treatment of wastewater is needed.

In the continuum of care, the following measures can be categorized as conventional capacity, which consists of providing patient care without any change in daily practices. This set of controls should already be implemented in general infection prevention and control plans in healthcare settings. Engineering controls  reduce exposures for HCP by placing a barrier between the hazard and the HCP. Engineering controls can be very effective as part of a suite of strategies to protect HCP without placing primary responsibility of implementation on them (i.e., they function without HCP having to take an action). Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 (i.e.,  person under investigation [PUI] ) should be placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) that has been constructed and maintained in accordance with current guidelines, as recommended in the  Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings . Barriers such as glass/plastic windows can be an effective solution for reducing exposures among HCP to potentially infectious patients. This approach can be effective in reception areas (e.g., intake desk at emergency department, triage station, information booth, pharmacy drop-off/pick-up windows) where patients may first report upon arrival to a healthcare facility. Other examples include the use of curtains between patients in shared areas and closed suctioning systems for airway suctioning for intubated patients. Another cornerstone of engineering controls are ventilation systems that provide air movement from a clean (HCP workstation or area) to contaminated (sick patient) flow direction (along with appropriate filtration, exchange rate) that are installed and properly maintained. Engineering controls  reduce exposures for HCP by placing a barrier between the hazard and the HCP. Engineering controls can be very effective as part of a suite of strategies to protect HCP without placing primary responsibility of implementation on them (i.e., they function without HCP having to take an action). Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 (i.e.,  person under investigation [PUI] ) should be placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) that has been constructed and maintained in accordance with current guidelines, as recommended in the  Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings . Barriers such as glass/plastic windows can be an effective solution for reducing exposures among HCP to potentially infectious patients. This approach can be effective in reception areas (e.g., intake desk at emergency department, triage station, information booth, pharmacy drop-off/pick-up windows) where patients may first report upon arrival to a healthcare facility. Other examples include the use of curtains between patients in shared areas and closed suctioning systems for airway suctioning for intubated patients.

Administrative controls  are employer-dictated work practices and policies that reduce or prevent hazardous exposures. Their effectiveness depends on employer commitment and HCP acceptance and consistent use of the strategies. Regular training, monitoring and reinforcement are necessary to ensure that policies and procedures are followed consistently. Many of these strategies should already be incorporated into existing infection prevention and control policies in healthcare settings. Consider developing mechanisms to screen patients for acute respiratory illness prior to their non-urgent care or elective visits or procedures, such as through the appointment reminder system. Postpone and reschedule those with signs and symptoms presenting for these non-acute visits. Current CDC guidance  recommends that, for COVID-19, only essential personnel enter the patient care area, and that facilities consider caring for these patients with dedicated HCP. Further limiting the numbers of healthcare personnel and patient contacts to those that are medically essential (e.g., excluding dietary personnel, environmental services) could limit the number of respirators used. The medically essential personnel would assume food delivery and environmental services. Measures can be explored to limit face-to-face contact encounters between HCP and patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. HCP may consider bundling care activities to minimize room entries, and bundling may occur across HCP types (e.g., food trays are delivered by HCP performing other care). Alternative mechanisms for HCP and patient interactions include telephones, video monitoring, and video-call applications on cell phones or tablets. Restrict visitors from entering the rooms of patients with known COVID-19 or suspected (PUI) COVID-19, as recommended in  CDCs guidance . Alternative mechanisms for patient and visitor interactions, such as video-call applications on cell phones or tablets should be explored. Facilities can consider exceptions based on end-of-life situations or when a visitor is essential for the patients emotional well-being and care. If visitors must enter the room of a known or suspected COVID-19 patient, facilities should provide instruction, before visitors enter patients rooms on use of PPE according to current facility policy while in the patients room. Identify and assess patients who may be ill with or who may have been exposed to a person with known COVID-19. Patients with  symptoms of suspected COVID-19  or other respiratory infection (e.g., fever, cough) presenting to care should  use facemasks pdf icon for source control until they can be placed in an airborne infection isolation room or a private room. Instructions should include how to use facemasks. Patients with these symptoms should not wear N95 respirators. If these patients need to leave their room for services in other areas of the hospital (e.g., radiology), they should also wear facemasks for source control. Cohorting is the practice of grouping together patients who are infected with the same organism to confine their care to one area and prevent contact with other patients. Cohorts are created based on clinical diagnosis, microbiologic confirmation when available, epidemiology, and mode of transmission of the infectious agent. Cohorting has been used extensively for managing outbreaks of multidrug resistant organisms including MRSA, VRE, MDR-ESBLs,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa;  methicillin-susceptible  Staphylococcus aureus , RSV, adenovirus keratoconjunctivitis, rotavirus, and SARS. When single patient rooms are not available, patients with confirmed COVID-19 may be placed in the same room. Cohorting patients could minimize respirator use when extended wear of respirators is implemented. For more information on cohorting of patients, refer to  2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings pdf icon . Assigning designated teams of HCP to provide care for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 could minimize respirator use when extended wear of RPDs is implemented. This strategy can also limit the number of exposed HCP who need to be fit tested. Nurse advice lines and telemedicine can screen and manage patients with suspected COVID-19 without the need for the HCP to use respiratory protection. Promoting the use of these technologies and referral networks can help triage persons to the appropriate level of care, potentially reducing the influx of patients to healthcare facilities seeking evaluation. It is important that HCP be trained on indications for use of N95 respirators. The  OSHA Respiratory Protection standard external icon  requires employers to provide respirator training prior to requiring an employee to use a respirator in the workplace. For example, HCP should use N95 respirators when caring for patients under airborne precautions for infectious diseases including COVID-19, tuberculosis, measles, and varicella. HCP should generally  not  need to use N95 respirators when caring for patients under droplet precautions for infectious diseases except under certain circumstances (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures for influenza). Training employees on the proper use of respirators, including putting on and removing them, limitations on their use, and maintenance is essential for effective use of respiratory protection. HCP should be thoroughly trained before they are fit tested to ensure they are comfortable donning the respirator and know how to conduct a user seal check. HCP should be trained on the respirator they are expecting to use at work. Just-in-time fit testing refers to the capacity of healthcare facilities to do larger scale evaluation, training, and fit testing of employees when necessary during a pandemic. Facilities may adopt a plan to use the just-in-time method for fit testing, which has been incorporated into pandemic plans for many facilities. For large facilities, it may not be feasible to fit test all employees, especially if their job does not typically place them at risk for exposure to airborne infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. If healthcare facilities are expecting to receive COVID-19 patients, they should begin training and start to plan for fit testing now. It is essential to have HCP trained and fit tested prior to receiving patients. In order to conserve the supply of N95 respirators, healthcare facilities should understand which of their HCP do and do not need to be in a respiratory protection program and thus medically evaluated, trained, and fit tested. If training and fit testing are conducted during two separate steps, it is possible to allow limited re-use of N95 respirators used by individual HCP during both steps. Employees should be fit tested after they are comfortable donning the respirator and have passed a user seal check. Employees should be trained on the respirator they are expecting to use at work. The respirator can be saved and used for fit testing and patient care. Respirator fit test methods are classified as either qualitative or quantitative, and there are multiple protocols of each classification that are  NIOSH-recommended  or meet the requirements of  OSHAs Respiratory Protection Standard external icon . A qualitative fit test is a pass/fail test to assess the adequacy of respirator fit that relies on the individuals sensory detection of a test agent. A quantitative fit test numerically measures the effectiveness of the respirator to seal with the wearers face, without relying on the wearers voluntary or involuntary response to a test agent. Quantitative fit tests involve adaptation of the respirator to the fit testing equipment, which can involve making holes in the respirator. Many healthcare systems already use qualitative fit test methods for fit testing HCP. For those using quantitative fit test methods, considerations can be made to use  qualitative fit test methods to minimize the destruction of an N95 respirator used in fit testing and allow for the re-use of the same N95 respirator by the HCP. Qualitative fit methods may also allow for rapid fit testing of larger numbers of HCP. Any switch in methods should be assessed to ensure proficiency of the fit testers in carrying out the test. Administrative controls  are employer-dictated work practices and policies that reduce or prevent hazardous exposures.

Cohorting is the practice of grouping together patients who are infected with the same organism to confine their care to one area and prevent contact with other patients. Cohorts are created based on clinical diagnosis, microbiologic confirmation when available, epidemiology, and mode of transmission of the infectious agent. Cohorting has been used extensively for managing outbreaks of multidrug resistant organisms including MRSA, VRE, MDR-ESBLs,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa;  methicillin-susceptible  Staphylococcus aureus , RSV, adenovirus keratoconjunctivitis, rotavirus, and SARS. When single patient rooms are not available, patients with confirmed COVID-19 may be placed in the same room. Cohorting patients could minimize respirator use when extended wear of respirators is implemented.

It is important that HCP be trained on indications for use of N95 respirators. The  OSHA Respiratory Protection standard external icon  requires employers to provide respirator training prior to requiring an employee to use a respirator in the workplace. For example, HCP should use N95 respirators when caring for patients under airborne precautions for infectious diseases including COVID-19, tuberculosis, measles, and varicella. HCP should generally  not  need to use N95 respirators when caring for patients under droplet precautions for infectious diseases except under certain circumstances (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures for influenza).

Respirator fit test methods are classified as either qualitative or quantitative, and there are multiple protocols of each classification that are  NIOSH-recommended  or meet the requirements of  OSHAs Respiratory Protection Standard external icon . A qualitative fit test is a pass/fail test to assess the adequacy of respirator fit that relies on the individuals sensory detection of a test agent. A quantitative fit test numerically measures the effectiveness of the respirator to seal with the wearers face, without relying on the wearers voluntary or involuntary response to a test agent. Quantitative fit tests involve adaptation of the respirator to the fit testing equipment, which can involve making holes in the respirator. Many healthcare systems already use qualitative fit test methods for fit testing HCP. For those using quantitative fit test methods, considerations can be made to use  qualitative fit test methods to minimize the destruction of an N95 respirator used in fit testing and allow for the re-use of the same N95 respirator by the HCP. Qualitative fit methods may also allow for rapid fit testing of larger numbers of HCP. Any switch in methods should be assessed to ensure proficiency of the fit testers in carrying out the test.

Respirator fit test methods are classified as either qualitative or quantitative, and there are multiple protocols of each classification that are  NIOSH-recommended  or meet the requirements of  OSHAs Respiratory Protection Standard external icon . A qualitative fit test is a pass/fail test to assess the adequacy of respirator fit that relies on the individuals sensory detection of a test agent. A quantitative fit test numerically measures the effectiveness of the respirator to seal with the wearers face, without relying on the wearers voluntary or involuntary response to a test agent. Quantitative fit tests involve adaptation of the respirator to the fit testing equipment, which can involve making holes in the respirator. Many healthcare systems already use qualitative fit test methods for fit testing HCP. For those using quantitative fit test methods, considerations can be made to use  qualitative fit test methods to minimize the destruction of an N95 respirator used in fit testing and allow for the re-use of the same N95 respirator by the HCP. Qualitative fit methods may also allow for rapid fit testing of larger numbers of HCP. Any switch in methods should be assessed to ensure proficiency of the fit testers in carrying out the test. While engineering and administrative controls should be considered first when selecting controls, the use of  personal protective equipment  ( PPE)  should also be part of a suite of strategies used to protect personnel. Proper use of respiratory protection by HCP requires a comprehensive program (including medical clearance, training, and fit testing) that complies with  OSHAs Respiratory Protection Standard external icon and a high level of HCP involvement and commitment. The program should also include provisions for the cleaning, disinfecting, inspection, repair, and storage of respirators used by workers on the job. Proper storage conditions can maximize shelf life of respirators. The following strategies in this section are traditionally used by some healthcare systems. If not already implemented, these strategies can be considered by healthcare settings in the face of a potential N95 respirator shortage before implementing the contingency strategies that are listed further below. Surgical N95 respirators  (sometimes called medical respirators) are recommended only for use by HCP who need protection from both airborne and fluid hazards (e.g., splashes, sprays). These respirators are approved by NIOSH and regulated by the FDA and are not used or needed outside of healthcare settings. In times of shortage, only HCP who are working in a sterile field or who may be exposed to high velocity splashes, sprays, or splatters of blood or body fluids should be provided these respirators. Other HCP can use standard N95 respirators. If surgical N95 respirators are not available, and there is a risk that the worker may be exposed to high velocity splashes, sprays, or splatters of blood or body fluids, then a faceshield should be worn over the standard N95 respirator. Use  alternatives to N95 respirators pdf icon  where feasible. These include other classes of filtering facepiece respirators, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. All of these alternatives will provide equivalent or higher protection than N95 respirators when properly worn. NIOSH maintains a searchable, online version of the  certified equipment list identifying all NIOSH-approved respirators. NIOSH approves other filtering facepiece respirators that are at least as protective as the N95. These include  N99, N100, P95, P99, P100, R95, R99, and R100 . Elastomeric respirators  are half-facepiece, tight-fitting respirators that are made of synthetic or rubber material permitting them to be repeatedly disinfected, cleaned, and reused. They are equipped with exchangeable filter cartridges. Similar to N95 respirators, elastomeric respirators require annual fit testing. Elastomeric respirators should not be used in surgical settings due to concerns that air coming out of the exhalation valve may contaminate the sterile field. PAPRs  are reusable respirators that are typically loose-fitting hoods or helmets. These respirators are battery-powered with blower that pulls air through attached filters or cartridges. The filter is typically a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Loose-fitting PAPRs do not require fit-testing and can be worn by people with facial hair. However, PAPRs should not be used in surgical settings due to concerns that the blower exhaust and exhaled air may contaminate the sterile field. Facilities using elastomeric respirators and PAPRs should have up to date cleaning/disinfection procedures, which are an essential part of use for protection against infectious agents.

Preparedness should focus on strengthening the systems and structures that support effective and well-coordinated communication,  and not solely on the development of communication messages. A good emergency communication plan encourages community leaders and stakeholders to plan now for a COVID-19 outbreak and other types of emergencies. Before an outbreak occurs, focus on raising awareness and educating audiences about nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and other public health respiratory infection-prevention strategies. Identify key community relationships and leverage them to help educate and prepare audiences. It takes time to build relationships. Engage internal and external partners and stakeholders early in your planning process.  Coordinating your planning efforts with them can help establish strong lines of communication and ensure that information is consistent before and during a COVID-19 outbreak in your community.

Before an outbreak occurs, focus on raising awareness and educating audiences about nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and other public health respiratory infection-prevention strategies. Identify key community relationships and leverage them to help educate and prepare audiences. It takes time to build relationships. Engage internal and external partners and stakeholders early in your planning process.  Coordinating your planning efforts with them can help establish strong lines of communication and ensure that information is consistent before and during a COVID-19 outbreak in your community.

Updated March 10, 2020 Emergency medical services (EMS) play a vital role in responding to requests for assistance, triaging patients, and providing emergency medical treatment and transport for ill persons. However, unlike patient care in the controlled environment of a healthcare facility, care and transports by EMS present unique challenges because of the nature of the setting, enclosed space during transport, frequent need for rapid medical decision-making, interventions with limited information, and a varying range of patient acuity and jurisdictional healthcare resources. When preparing for and responding to patients with confirmed or possible coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), close coordination and effective communications are important among 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) commonly known as 911 call centers, the EMS system, healthcare facilities, and the public health system. Each PSAP and EMS system should seek the involvement of an EMS medical director to provide appropriate medical oversight. For the purposes of this guidance, EMS clinician means prehospital EMS and medical first responders. When COVID-19 is suspected in a patient needing emergency transport, prehospital care providers and healthcare facilities should be notified in advance that they may be caring for, transporting, or receiving a patient who may have COVID-19 infection. Case Definition for COVID-19 CDCs most current case definition  for a person under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19. Municipalities and local EMS authorities should coordinate with state and local public health, PSAPs, and other emergency call centers to determine need for modified caller queries about COVID-19, outlined below. Development of these modified caller queries should be closely coordinated with an EMS medical director and informed by local, state, and federal public health authorities, including the city or county health department(s), state health department(s), and CDC. PSAPs or Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) centers (as appropriate) should question callers and determine the possibility that this call concerns a person who may have signs or symptoms  and  risk factors for COVID-19. The query process should never supersede the provision of pre-arrival instructions to the caller when immediate lifesaving interventions (e.g., CPR or the Heimlich maneuver) are indicated. Patients in the United States who meet the appropriate criteria should be evaluated and transported as a PUI. Information on COVID-19 will be updated as the public health response proceeds. PSAPs and medical directors can access CDCs  PUI definitions here . Information on a possible PUI should be communicated immediately to EMS clinicians before arrival on scene in order to allow use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). PSAPs should utilize medical dispatch procedures that are coordinated with their EMS medical director and with the local or state public health department. PSAPs and EMS units that respond to ill travelers at US international airports or other ports of entry to the United States (maritime ports or border crossings) should be in contact with the CDC quarantine station of jurisdiction for the port of entry (see:  CDC Quarantine Station Contact List ) for planning guidance. They should notify the quarantine station when responding to that location if a communicable disease is suspected in a traveler. CDC has provided job aids for this purpose to EMS units operating routinely at US ports of entry. The PSAP or EMS unit can also call CDCs Emergency Operations Center at (770) 488-7100 to be connected with the appropriate CDC quarantine station.

This guidance applies to all first responders, including law enforcement, fire services, emergency medical services, and emergency management officials, who anticipate close contact with persons with confirmed or possible COVID-19 in the course of their work. EMS clinician practices should be based on the most up-to-date COVID-19 clinical recommendations and information from appropriate public health authorities and EMS medical direction. State and local EMS authorities may direct EMS clinicians to modify their practices as described below. If a patient with an exposure history and signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 requires transport to a healthcare facility for further evaluation and management (subject to EMS medical direction), the following actions should occur during transport: The following are general guidelines for cleaning or maintaining EMS transport vehicles and equipment after transporting a PUI: EMS clinicians should be aware of the follow-up and/or reporting measures they should take after caring for a PUI or patient with confirmed COVID-19: The responsibilities described in this section are not specific for the care and transport of PUIs or patients with confirmed COVID-19.

CDC is reviewing all data on COVID-19 transmission as information becomes available. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through sewerage systems is thought to be low. Although transmission of COVID-19 through sewage may be possible, there is no evidence to date that this has occurred. This guidance will be updated as necessary as new evidence is assessed. SARS, a similar coronavirus, has been detected in untreated sewage for up to 2 to 14 days. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, there was documented transmission associated with sewage aerosols. Data suggest that standard municipal wastewater system chlorination practices may be sufficient to inactivate coronaviruses, as long as utilities monitor free available chlorine during treatment to ensure it has not been depleted. Wastewater and sewage workers should use standard practices, practice basic hygiene precautions, and wear personal protective equipment ( PPE ) as prescribed for current work tasks.

CDC has taken early and aggressive actions to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the United States, through a  combination of proven public health actions . At the same time, CDC is preparing for the possibility that the COVID-19 situation in the U.S.could become more serious, with sustained community transmission, and is taking steps to make sure there are enough supplies and appropriate guidance to prevent spread of disease, especially among healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19. Healthcare personnel can protect themselves when caring for patients by adhering to infection prevention and control practices, which includes the appropriate use of engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment (PPE). CDC has issued  guidance recommending the use of PPE for healthcare personnel caring for patients with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. Employers and healthcare personnel are reminded that PPE is only one aspect of safe care of patients with COVID-19. For the general public, CDC does not recommend the use of facemasks or respirators. CDC guidance is based on what we know about SARS-CoV-2 and what we know about similar coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS. CDC also understands the importance of providing guidance that healthcare facilities can implement, given supplies of PPE available. CDC communicates regularly with healthcare industry partners, as well as PPE manufacturers and distributors, to assess availability of PPE. At this time, some partners are reporting higher than usual demand for select N95 respirators and facemasks. If information about market availability changes, updates will be posted on this page. Based on the current COVID-19 situation and availability of PPE, CDC has specific recommendations, summarized below. As we learn more about COVID-19 and as the needs of the response or availability of PPE within U.S. healthcare facilities changes, we will update our guidance. Patients  with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection should wear a  facemask  when being evaluated medically. Healthcare personnel  should adhere to  Standard ,  Contact, and Airborne  Precautions, including the use of eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield) when caring for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These precautions include the use of PPE, including NIOSH-approved N95 respirators, gowns, gloves, face shield/eye protection, etc. This includes, but is not limited to, surgical N95 respirators. CDC does NOT currently recommend the general public use facemasks. Instead, CDC recommends following  everyday preventive actions , such as washing your hands, covering your cough, and staying home when you are sick. Summary as of February 25, 2020 Cases of COVID-19 are being reported in numerous countries  around the world . Given decreases in exports from select countries (e.g., China, India, Taiwan) and increases in demand due to the global outbreak, manufacturers of select types of PPE are reporting increased volume of orders and challenges in meeting order demands. Specific challenges are being reported for N95 respirators and facemasks. Orders received are up to 10-fold normal demand for these items. Plans for surge manufacturing globally are underway. Distributors of select types of PPE are reporting an increased volume of orders from customers and challenges in meeting order demands for personal protective equipment, specifically for N95 respirators and facemasks. Due to decreased exports from overseas by manufacturers, distributors are reporting that these items are being placed on allocation, and orders are being filled based on historical demands for existing customers. At present, shortfalls may be anticipated to continue for the next 34 months. U.S. healthcare systems are reporting higher than normal use for N95 respirators, due to fit testing and stockpiling, to prepare for possible widespread COVID-19 transmission.

Hand washing mechanically removes pathogens, while laboratory data demonstrate that 60% ethanol and 70% isopropanol, the active ingredients in CDC-recommended alcohol-based hand sanitizers, inactivates viruses that are genetically related to, and with similar physical properties as, the 2019-nCoV. While the exact role of direct and indirect spread of coronaviruses between people that could be reduced by hand hygiene is unknown at this time, hand hygiene for infection prevention is an important part of the U.S. response to the international emergence of COVID-19.

There are a number of factors to consider when determining the need to postpone or cancel a large gathering. These include: The overall number of attendees . Larger gatherings (for example, more than 250 people) offer more opportunities for person-to-person contact and therefore pose greater risk of COVID-19 transmission. The number of people attending who are at greater risk of more serious illness after contracting COVID-19 . Older adults and persons with severe pre-existing health conditions are thought to be at increased risk. The density of attendees within a confined area.  Based on what is currently known about the virus, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within 6 feet). The potential economic impact to participants, attendees, staff, and the larger community. The level of transmission in your local community and the level of transmission in the areas from which your attendees will travel.  To better understand the level of community transmission in your community (and in the communities from which your attendees will be traveling), consult with your local and/or state public health department. If there are ways in which to significantly reduce the number of attendees.  For example, for sporting events or school concerts, organizers could consider holding the event but significantly reduce the number of audience members. At a minimal-to-moderate level of community transmission, it is recommended to: Cancel community-wide mass gatherings (for example, >250 people;  the cutoff threshold is at the discretion of community leadership based on the  current circumstances the community is facing and the nature of the event pdf icon ) or move to smaller groupings.

The details of your emergency operations plan should be based on the size and duration of your events, demographics of the participants, complexity of your event operations, and type of on-site services and activities your event may offer. Review the existing emergency operations plans for your venues  Meet with the emergency operations coordinator or planning team at your venues.  Discuss the emergency operations plans and determine how they may impact aspects of your events, such as personnel, security, services and activities, functions, and resources. Work with the emergency operations coordinator or planning team to prepare for the key prevention strategies outlined in this guidance. Develop a contingency plan that addresses various scenarios described below which you may encounter during a COVID-19 outbreak. Establish relationships with key community partners and stakeholders.  When forming key relationships for your events, include relevant partners such as the local public health department, community leaders, faith-based organizations, vendors, suppliers, hospitals, hotels, airlines, transportation companies, and law enforcement. Collaborate and coordinate with them on broader planning efforts. Clearly identify each partners role, responsibilities, and decision-making authority. Contact your local public health department for a copy of their outbreak response and mitigation plan for your community. Participate in community-wide emergency preparedness activities. Address key prevention strategies in your emergency operations plan Promote the daily practice of everyday preventive actions.  Use  health messages and materials developed by credible public health sources such as CDC  or your local public health department to encourage your event staff and participants to practice good personal health habits. Consider displaying signs (physical and/or electronic) throughout the event to provide frequent reminders to participants to engage in  everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These include: Handshakes and high-fives are often exchanged at meetings and sporting events, and these can be ways in which COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person. As a way of decreasing the social pressure to engage in these common behaviors, consider displaying signs (physical and/or electronic) that discourage these actions during the gathering. Note: Use culturally appropriate messages, materials, and resources. Provide COVID-19 prevention supplies to event staff and participants.  Ensure that your events have supplies for event staff and participants, such as hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, tissues, trash baskets, disposable facemasks, and cleaners and disinfectants. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects with detergent and water prior to disinfection, especially surfaces that are visibly dirty. Note:  Disposable facemasks pdf icon  should be kept on-site and used only if someone (worker or attendee) becomes sick at your event. Those who become sick should be immediately isolated from staff and participants who are not sick and given a clean disposable facemask to wear. Note: Use culturally appropriate messages, materials, and resources. Plan for staff absences.  Develop and implement flexible attendance and sick-leave policies. Event staff need to stay home when they are sick, or they may need to stay home to care for a sick household member or care for their children in the event of school dismissals. Allow staff to work from home when possible. Identify critical job functions and positions and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff (similar to planning for holiday staffing). Provide instructions about how and when to safely return to work. Implement exible staff attendance and sick-leave policies (if possible).  Require staff to stay home if they are sick or caring for a sick household member. Notify staff when you plan to implement  COVID-19 leave policies . Note: Direct staff who get sick with  COVID-19 symptoms  to avoid contact with others and to seek medical advice.  Consider alternatives for event staff and participants who are at increased risk for complications from COVID-19.  Currently,  older adults and persons with severe underlying health conditions  are considered to be at increased risk for severe illness and complications from COVID-19. Event organizers can consider reassigning duties for higher-risk staff to have minimal contact with other persons. People in higher-risk groups should consult with their healthcare provider about attending large events. Consider providing refunds to event participants who are unable to attend because they are at high risk and/or provide information on alternative viewing options. Promote messages that discourage people who are sick from attending events.  This could include electronic messages sent to attendees prior to travel to the event as well as messages requesting that people leave events if they begin to have symptoms of COVID-19, which include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Attendees should be encouraged to seek medical advice promptly by calling ahead to a doctors office or emergency room to get guidance. See CDC guidance on  what to do when sick with COVID-19 . Note: Use culturally appropriate messages, materials, and resources. If possible, identify a space that can be used to isolate staff or participants who become ill at the event.  Designate a space for staff and participants who may become sick and cannot leave the event immediately. Work with partners, such as local hospitals, to create a plan for treating staff and participants who do not live nearby. Include a  plan for separating and caring for vulnerable populations . If any staff member or participant becomes sick at your event, separate them from others as soon as possible. Establish procedures to help sick staff or participants leave the event as soon as possible. Provide them with clean,  disposable facemasks pdf icon  to wear, if available. Work with the local public health department and nearby hospitals to care for those who become sick. If needed, contact emergency services for those who need emergency care.

{"scrapedAt": "2020-04-02T02:03:00", "title": "Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Contingency Capacity Strategies", "publishedAt": "2020-03-16T00:00:00", "content": "In the continuum of care, the following measures can be categorized as contingency capacity, which may change daily practices but may not have any significant impact on the care delivered to the patient or the safety of the HCP. 1 The following measures may be considered in the setting of a potential impending shortage of N95 respirators. The decision to implement these practices should be made on a case by case basis taking into account known characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 and local conditions (e.g., number of disposable N95 respirators available, current respirator usage rate, success of other respirator conservation strategies, etc.). Currently, CDC recommends discharge of patients with confirmed COVID-19 when they are medically stable and have an appropriate home environment to which to return. CDC lists considerations for care at home in:  Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) . If patients cannot be discharged to home for social rather than medical reasons, public health officials might need to identify alternative non-hospital housing where those patients can convalesce. In times of shortage, consideration can be made to use N95 respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life. However, expired respirators might not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the strap and material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Because of this, use of expired respirators could be prioritized for situations where HCP are NOT exposed to pathogens, such as training and fit testing. As expired respirators can still serve an important purpose, healthcare facilities should retain all N95 respirators during the early phases of this outbreak. Practices allowing extended use of N95 respirators, when acceptable, can also be considered. The decision to implement policies that permit extended use of N95 respirators should be made by the professionals who manage the institutions respiratory protection program, in consultation with their occupational health and infection control departments with input from the state/local public health departments. CDC has  recommended guidance on implementation of extended use of N95 respirators in healthcare settings. Extended use has been recommended and widely used as an option for conserving respirators during previous respiratory pathogen outbreaks and pandemics. Extended use  refers to the practice of wearing the same N95 respirator for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients, without removing the respirator between patient encounters. 2 Extended use is well suited to situations wherein multiple patients with the same infectious disease diagnosis, whose care requires use of a respirator, are cohorted (e.g., housed on the same hospital unit). It can also be considered to be used for care of patients with tuberculosis, varicella, and measles. Re-use  refers to the practice of using the same N95 respirator by one HCP for multiple encounters with different patients but removing it (i.e. doffing) after each encounter. 2 This practice is often referred to as limited reuse because restrictions are in place to limit the number of times the same respirator is reused. It is important to consult with the respirator manufacturer regarding the maximum number of donnings or uses they recommend for the N95 respirator model. If no manufacturer guidance is available, data suggests limiting the number of reuses to no more than five uses per device to ensure an adequate safety margin. 3 N95 and other disposable respirators should not be shared by multiple HCP. CDC has  recommended guidance on implementation of limited re-use of N95 respirators in healthcare settings. For pathogens for which contact transmission is not a concern, routine limited reuse of single-use disposable respirators has been practiced for decades. For example, for tuberculosis prevention, a respirator classified as disposable can be reused by the same provider as long as the respirator maintains its structural and functional integrity. To extend the supply of N95 respirators during an anticipated dwindling supply, HCP could be encouraged to reuse their N95 respirators when caring for patients with tuberculosis disease. 4 To maintain the integrity of the respirator, it is important for HCP to hang used respirators in a designated storage area or keep them in a clean, breathable container such as a paper bag between uses. It is not recommended to modify the N95 respirator by placing any material within the respirator or over the respirator. Modification may negatively affect the performance of the respirator and could void the NIOSH approval. In the continuum of care, the following measures can be categorized as contingency capacity, which may change daily practices but may not have any significant impact on the care delivered to the patient or the safety of the HCP. 1 The following measures may be considered in the setting of a potential impending shortage of N95 respirators. The decision to implement these practices should be made on a case by case basis taking into account known characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 and local conditions (e.g., number of disposable N95 respirators available, current respirator usage rate, success of other respirator conservation strategies, etc.). Currently, CDC recommends discharge of patients with confirmed COVID-19 when they are medically stable and have an appropriate home environment to which to return. CDC lists considerations for care at home in:  Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) . If patients cannot be discharged to home for social rather than medical reasons, public health officials might need to identify alternative non-hospital housing where those patients can convalesce. In times of shortage, consideration can be made to use N95 respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life. However, expired respirators might not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the strap and material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Because of this, use of expired respirators could be prioritized for situations where HCP are NOT exposed to pathogens, such as training and fit testing. As expired respirators can still serve an important purpose, healthcare facilities should retain all N95 respirators during the early phases of this outbreak.

Vertical transmission includes transmission of a pathogen from a mother to her fetus or newborn before, during, or immediately after delivery. Transplacental transmission occurs during pregnancy when maternal viremia leads to transmission across the placenta (e.g., Zika virus). Perinatal transmission at the time of delivery can occur when the newborn comes into exposure with maternal bodily fluids during delivery (e.g., as occurs with herpes simplex virus [HSV]), through transmission of infectious virus through the breastmilk (e.g., as occurs with HIV), or other bodily fluids (e.g., as occurs with group B  Streptococcus  and vaginal fluids, influenza viruses and respiratory droplets), and some pathogens are transmitted by multiple routes. In limited recent case series of infants born to mothers with COVID-19 published in the peer-reviewed literature, none of the infants have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.* Additionally, virus was not detected in samples of amniotic fluid.

Based on limited case reports, adverse infant outcomes (e.g., preterm birth) have been reported among infants born to mothers positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy. However, it is not clear that these outcomes were related to maternal infection, and at this time the risk of adverse infant outcomes is not known. Given the limited data available related to COVID-19 during pregnancy, knowledge of adverse outcomes from other respiratory viral infections may provide some information. For example, other respiratory viral infections during pregnancy, such as influenza, have been associated with adverse neonatal outcomes, including low birth weight and preterm birth. Additionally, having a cold or influenza with high fever early in pregnancy may increase the risk of certain birth defects. Infants born preterm and/or small for gestational age have been reported among infants born to mothers with other coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, during pregnancy. At this time, there is no information on long-term health effects on infants either with COVID-19, or those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in utero.

Infants born preterm and/or small for gestational age have been reported among infants born to mothers with other coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, during pregnancy. Based on limited case reports, adverse infant outcomes (e.g., preterm birth) have been reported among infants born to mothers positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy. However, it is not clear that these outcomes were related to maternal infection, and at this time the risk of adverse infant outcomes is not known.

We do not currently know if pregnant women have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result. Pregnant women experience changes in their bodies that may increase their risk of some infections. With viruses from the same family as COVID-19, and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, women have had a higher risk of developing severe illness. It is always important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses. Pregnant women should do the same things as the general public to avoid infection. You can help stop the spread of COVID-19 by taking these actions: You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 disease at CDCs ( Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus ). We do not know at this time if COVID-19 would cause problems during pregnancy or affect the health of the baby after birth. We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus that causes COVID-19 to her fetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. No infants born to mothers with COVID-19 have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. In these cases, which are a small number, the virus was not found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk. We do not know at this time what if any risk is posed to infants of a pregnant woman who has COVID-19. There have been a small number of reported problems with pregnancy or delivery (e.g. preterm birth) in babies born to mothers who tested positive for COVID-19 during their pregnancy.

Interim Guidance on Breastfeeding for a Mother Confirmed or Under Investigation For COVID-19 This interim guidance is intended for women who are confirmed to have COVID-19 or are persons-under-investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 and are currently breastfeeding. This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about COVID-19 and the transmission of other viral respiratory infections. CDC will update this interim guidance as needed as additional information becomes available. For breastfeeding guidance in the immediate postpartum setting, refer to Interim Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control of 2019 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings . Much is unknown about  how COVID-19 is spread . Person-to-person spread is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza (flu) and other respiratory pathogens spread. In limited studies on women with COVID-19 and another coronavirus infection, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), the virus has not been detected in breast milk; however we do not know whether mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus via breast milk. Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses. There are rare exceptions when breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk is not recommended . CDC has no specific guidance for breastfeeding during infection with similar viruses like SARS-CoV or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). Outside of the immediate postpartum setting, CDC recommends that a mother with flu continue breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk to her infant while taking precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant. Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for most infants. However, much is unknown about COVID-19. Whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding should be determined by the mother in coordination with her family and healthcare providers. A mother with confirmed COVID-19 or who is a symptomatic PUI should take all possible precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant, including washing her hands before touching the infant and wearing a face mask, if possible, while feeding at the breast. If expressing breast milk with a manual or electric breast pump, the mother should wash her hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and follow recommendations for proper pump cleaning after each use. If possible, consider having someone who is well feed the expressed breast milk to the infant.

Updated March 12, 2020 Based on the current COVID-19 situation and availability of  personal protective equipment (PPE) , CDC has specific recommendations, summarized below. As we learn more about COVID-19 and as the needs of the response or availability of PPE within U.S. healthcare facilities changes, we will update our guidance. Patients  with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection should wear a  facemask  when being evaluated medically. Healthcare personnel should adhere to Standard and Transmission-based Precautions when caring for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recommended PPE is described in the  Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings . CDC does NOT currently recommend the general public use facemasks. Instead, CDC recommends following  everyday preventive actions , such as washing your hands, covering your cough, and staying home when you are sick. Cases of COVID-19 are being reported in China as well as other countries. Given decreases in exports from select countries (e.g., China, India, Taiwan) and increases in demand due to the outbreak, manufacturers of select types of PPE are reporting increased volume of orders and challenges in meeting order demands. Plans to surge manufacturing globally are underway. On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary declared that circumstances exist to justify the authorization of emergency use of additional respiratory protective devices in healthcare settings during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Updated March 12, 2020 Based on the current COVID-19 situation and availability of  personal protective equipment (PPE) , CDC has specific recommendations, summarized below. As we learn more about COVID-19 and as the needs of the response or availability of PPE within U.S. healthcare facilities changes, we will update our guidance. Patients  with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection should wear a  facemask  when being evaluated medically. Healthcare personnel should adhere to Standard and Transmission-based Precautions when caring for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recommended PPE is described in the  Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings . CDC does NOT currently recommend the general public use facemasks. Instead, CDC recommends following  everyday preventive actions , such as washing your hands, covering your cough, and staying home when you are sick. Cases of COVID-19 are being reported in China as well as other countries. Given decreases in exports from select countries (e.g., China, India, Taiwan) and increases in demand due to the outbreak, manufacturers of select types of PPE are reporting increased volume of orders and challenges in meeting order demands. Plans to surge manufacturing globally are underway. On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary declared that circumstances exist to justify the authorization of emergency use of additional respiratory protective devices in healthcare settings during the COVID-19 outbreak.

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping. The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in some affected  geographic areas . Community spread  means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Different parts of the country are seeing different levels of COVID-19 activity. The United States nationally is in the initiation phase of the pandemic. States in which community spread is occurring are in the acceleration phase.

Limited information is available to characterize the spectrum of clinical illness, transmission efficiency, and the duration of viral shedding for immunocompromised persons with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Experience from other respiratory viral infections, in particular influenza, suggests that persons with COVID-19 may shed detectable viral material and potentially infectious virus for an extended period of time after recovery. Where there is concern that immunocompromised persons (e.g., medical treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, bone marrow or solid organ transplant recipients, inherited immunodeficiency, poorly controlled HIV) may continue to shed virus after recovery, jurisdictions may wish to consider the utility of a test-based strategy. However, a test-based strategy is contingent on the availability of ample testing supplies and laboratory capacity as well as convenient access to testing and in the absence of these conditions may not be feasible. Maintain home isolation until: When a test-based strategy is not feasible or desired, healthcare providers and public health officials should follow the non-test-based strategy outlined in the guidance for non-immunocompromised persons.

Due to widespread transmission in Santa, Clara, CA, CDC recommends expanded and laser focused community mitigation activities to help slow the spread of respiratory virus infections including the novel coronavirus SARS-C0V-2, the cause of the disease COVID-19. These approaches are used to minimize morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 as well as to minimize the social and economic impacts of COVID-19. Individuals, communities, businesses, and healthcare organizations are all part of a community mitigation strategy. Given the focal community transmission in Santa Clara, CA, and the involvement of multiple health care facilities, substantial interventions should be implemented at this time, based on the urgency of protecting the health care system with expected rise in cases by slowing the spread within the community (Table) and focused on protecting the vulnerable members of the community.

The following measures are  not  commensurate with current U.S. standards of care.

It is important to consult with entities that include some combination of: local healthcare coalitions, federal, state, or local public health officials, appropriate state agencies that are managing the overall emergency response related to COVID-19, and state crisis standards of care committees. Even when state/local healthcare coalitions or public health authorities can shift resources between health care facilities, these strategies may still be necessary. Consideration can be made to use N95 respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for care of patients with COVID-19, tuberculosis, measles, and varicella. However, respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life may not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the straps and nose bridge material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Many models found in U.S. stockpiles and stockpiles of healthcare facilities have been found to continue to perform in accordance with NIOSH performance standards.

It is optimal to use these respirators in the context of a respiratory protection program that includes medical evaluation, training, and fit testing. If used in healthcare delivery, it is particularly important that HCP perform the expected seal check, prior to entering a patient care area. CDC does not recommend using N95s beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life in surgical settings. Other countries approve respirators for occupational use and approve respirators to these standards. These products are evaluated using some methods similar to those used by NIOSH, and some methods that are different, but are expected to protect HCPs. These respirators are expected to provide protection to workers. Those with equivalent or similar protection to NIOSH-approved respirators may be available to provide respiratory protection to workers exposed to harmful airborne particulate matter. These devices are expected to be suitable alternatives to provide protection during the COVID-19 response when supplies are short. The country, conformity assessment standards, acceptable product classifications, standards and guidance documents, and protection factor determination are provided in alphabetical order. All of these respirators have protection factors of at least 10 in the countries listed below, as outlined in the standards and guidance documents specified. P2 PFF2 KN95 KP95 FFP2 DS/DL2 1st N99, P99, R99 N95, P95, R95 Limited re-use of N95 respirators when caring for patients with COVID-19 might become necessary. However, it is unknown what the potential contribution of contact transmission is for SARS-CoV-2, and caution should be used. Re-use should be implemented according to  CDC guidance . Re-use has been recommended as an option for conserving respirators during previous respiratory pathogen outbreaks and pandemics. It may also be necessary to re-use N95 respirators when caring for patients with varicella or measles, although contact transmission poses a risk to HCP who implement this practice. Use of additional N95 respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for care of patients with COVID-19, tuberculosis, measles, and varicella can be considered. However, respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life may not perform to the requirements for which they were certified. Over time, components such as the straps and nose bridge material may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Some models have been found NOT to perform in accordance with NIOSH performances standards, and consideration may be given to use these respirators as identified in  Release of Stockpiled N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators Beyond the Manufacturer-Designated Shelf Life: Considerations for the COVID-19 Response . In addition, consideration can be given to use N95 respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life that have not been evaluated by NIOSH. It is optimal to use these respirators in the context of a respiratory protection program that includes medical evaluation, training, and fit testing. It is particularly important that HCP perform the expected seal check, prior to entering a patient care area. The number of infectious particles required to cause an infection (infectious dose) is often uncertain or unknown for respiratory pathogens. Further, there is often uncertainty about the influence of factors such as exposure duration and nature of clinical symptoms on the likelihood of infection transmission from person-to-person. When facemasks must be used by HCP entering a patient care area, source control (i.e. masking of symptomatic patients) and maintaining distance from the patient are particularly important to reduce the risk of transmission. This prioritization approach to conservation is intended to be used when N95 respirators are so limited that routinely practiced standards of care for all HCP wearing N95 respirators when caring for a COVID-19 patient are no longer possible. N95 respirators beyond their manufacture-designated shelf life, when available, are preferable to use of facemasks. The use of N95s or elastomeric respirators or PAPRs should be prioritized for HCP with the highest potential exposures including being present in the room during aerosol generating procedures performed on symptomatic persons. Suggested facemask or respirator use, based upon distance from a patient with suspected or known COVID-19 and use of source control* * Based on availability, organizations may require and/or individuals may voluntarily choose to utilize higher levels of protection During severe resource limitations, consider excluding HCP who may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as those of older age, those with chronic medical conditions, or those who may be pregnant, from caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. It may be possible to designate HCP who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 to preferentially provide care for additional patients with COVID-19. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection may have developed some protective immunity, but this has not yet been confirmed. Portable fan devices with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration that are carefully placed can increase the effective air changes per hour of clean air to the patient room, reducing risk to individuals entering the room without respiratory protection. NIOSH has developed guidance for using portable HEPA filtration systems to create expedient patient isolation rooms. The expedient patient isolation room approach involves establishing a high-ventilation-rate, negative pressure, inner isolation zone that sits within a clean larger ventilated zone. In the absence of any remaining supply of N95 respirators, it may be possible to use this technology in conjunction with HCP wearing facemasks. NIOSH has developed the ventilated headboard that draws exhaled air from a patient in bed into a HEPA filter, decreasing risk of HCP exposure to patient-generated aerosol. This technology consists of lightweight, sturdy, and adjustable aluminum framing with a retractable plastic canopy. The ventilated headboard can be deployed in combination with HEPA fan/filter units to provide surge isolation capacity within a variety of environments, from traditional patient rooms to triage stations, and emergency medical shelters. In the absence of any remaining supply of N95 respirators, it may be possible to use this technology in conjunction with HCP and/or patients wearing facemasks. In settings where N95 respirators are so limited that routinely practiced standards of care for wearing N95 respirators and equivalent or higher level of protection respirators are no longer possible, and surgical masks are not available, as a last resort, it may be necessary for HCP to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks. It may be considered to use these masks for care of patients with COVID-19, tuberculosis, measles, and varicella. However, caution should be exercised when considering this option. 1,2 These crisis capacity or alternate strategies accompany and build on the conventional and contingency capacity strategies.

Purpose:  This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of isolation gowns in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare facilities can refer to  COVID-19 preparedness plans . Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no widely accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of isolation gowns during the COVID-19 response. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve isolation gown supplies along the continuum of care. The following contingency and crisis strategies are based upon these assumptions: Use isolation gown alternatives that offer equivalent or higher protection.  Several fluid-resistant and impermeable protective clothing options are available in the marketplace for HCP. These include isolation gowns and surgical gowns. When selecting the most appropriate protective clothing, employers should consider all of the available information on recommended protective clothing, including the potential limitations. Nonsterile, disposable patient isolation gowns, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are appropriate for use by HCP when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In times of gown shortages, surgical gowns should be prioritized for surgical and other sterile procedures. Current U.S. guidelines do not require use of gowns that  conform to any standards .  Selectively cancel elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a gown is typically used by HCP .  Shift gown use towards cloth isolation gowns.  Reusable (i.e., washable) gowns are typically made of polyester or polyester-cotton fabrics. Gowns made of these fabrics can be safely laundered according to  routine procedures and reused. Care should be taken to ensure that HCP do not touch outer surfaces of the gown during care. Consider the use of coveralls.  Coveralls  typically provide 360-degree protection because they are designed to cover the whole body, including the back and lower legs, and sometimes the head and feet as well. While the material and seam barrier properties are essential for defining the protective level, the coverage provided by the material used in the garment design, as well as certain features including closures, will greatly affect the protective level. HCP unfamiliar with the use of coveralls must be trained and practiced in their use, prior to using during patient care. In the United States, the  NFPA 1999 standard external icon  specifies the minimum design, performance, testing, documentation, and certification requirements for new single-use and new multiple-use emergency medical operations protective clothing, including coveralls for HCP. Use of expired gowns beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for training. The majority of isolation gowns do not have a manufacturer-designated shelf life. However, consideration can be made to using gowns that do and are past their manufacturer-designated shelf life. If there is no date available on the gown label or packaging, facilities should contact the manufacturer. Use gowns or coveralls conforming to international standards. Current guidelines do not require use of gowns that conform to any standards. In times of shortages, healthcare facilities can consider using  international gowns and coveralls . Gowns and coveralls that conform to international standards, including with EN 13795 and EN14126, could be reserved for activities that may involve moderate to high amounts of body fluids. Cancel all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a gown is typically used by HCP. Extended use of isolation gowns. \nConsideration can be made to extend the use of isolation gowns (disposable or cloth) such that the same gown is worn by the same HCP when interacting with more than one patient known to be infected with the same infectious disease when these patients housed in the same location (i.e., COVID-19 patients residing in an isolation cohort). This can be considered only if there are no additional co-infectious diagnoses transmitted by contact (such as  Clostridioides difficile ) among patients. If the gown becomes visibly soiled, it must be removed and discarded as per  usual practices pdf icon . Re-use of cloth isolation gowns. \nDisposable gowns are not typically amenable to being doffed and re-used because the ties and fasteners typically break during doffing. Cloth isolation gowns could potentially be untied and retied and could be considered for re-use without laundering in between. In a situation where the gown is being used as part of standard precautions to protect HCP from a splash, the risk of re-using a non-visibly soiled cloth isolation gown may be lower. However, for care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, HCP risk from re-use of cloth isolation gowns without laundering among (1) single HCP caring for multiple patients using one gown or (2) among multiple HCP sharing one gown is unclear. The goal of this strategy is to minimize exposures to HCP and not necessarily prevent transmission between patients. Any gown that becomes visibly soiled during patient care should be disposed of and cleaned. Prioritize gowns. \nGowns should be prioritized for the following activities: Surgical gowns should be prioritized for surgical and other sterile procedures. Facilities may consider suspending use of gowns for endemic multidrug resistant organisms (e.g., MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing organisms). Consider using gown alternatives that have not been evaluated as effective. In situation of severely limited or no available isolation gowns, the following pieces of clothing can be considered as a last resort for care of COVID-19 patients as single use. However, none of these options can be considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown.

Surge capacity refers to the ability to manage a sudden, unexpected increase in patient volume that would otherwise severely challenge or exceed the present capacity of a facility. While there are no commonly accepted measurements or triggers to distinguish surge capacity from daily patient care capacity, surge capacity is a useful framework to approach a decreased supply of eye protection during the COVID-19 response. Three general strata have been used to describe surge capacity and can be used to prioritize measures to conserve eye protection supplies along the continuum of care. The following contingency and crisis strategies are based upon these assumptions: Use eye protection according to product labeling and local, state, and federal requirements.  Selectively cancel elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which eye protection is typically used by HCP. Shift eye protection supplies from disposable to re-usable devices (i.e., goggles and reusable face shields).  Implement extended use of eye protection. Extended use of eye protection is the practice of wearing the same eye protection for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients, without removing eye protection between patient encounters. Extended use of eye protection can be applied to disposable and reusable devices. Cancel all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which eye protection is typically used by HCP.  Use eye protection devices beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life during patient care activities.  If there is no date available on the eye protection device label or packaging, facilities should contact the manufacturer. The user should visually inspect the product prior to use and, if there are concerns (such as degraded materials), discard the product. Prioritize eye protection for selected activities such as: Consider using safety glasses (e.g., trauma glasses) that have extensions to cover the side of the eyes.  Exclude HCP at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 from contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.  Designate convalescent HCP for provision of care to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.  Adhere to recommended manufacturer instructions for cleaning and disinfection.

Healthcare facilities can consider removing all facemasks from public areas. Facemasks can be available to provide to symptomatic patients upon check in at entry points. All facemasks should be placed in a secure and monitored site. This is especially important in high-traffic areas like emergency departments. Implement extended use of facemasks . Extended use of facemasks is the practice of wearing the same facemask for repeated close contact encounters with several different patients, without removing the facemask between patient encounters. Restrict facemasks to use by HCP, rather than patients for source control. Have patients with symptoms of respiratory infection use tissues or other barriers to cover their mouth and nose. Cancel all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a facemask is typically used by HCP. Use facemasks beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life during patient care activities.  If there is no date available on the facemask label or packaging, facilities should contact the manufacturer. The user should visually inspect the product prior to use and, if there are concerns (such as degraded materials or visible tears), discard the product. Implement limited re-use of facemasks.  Limited re-use of facemasks is the practice of using the same facemask by one HCP for multiple encounters with different patients but removing it after each encounter. As it is unknown what the potential contribution of contact transmission is for SARS-CoV-2, care should be taken to ensure that HCP do not touch outer surfaces of the mask during care, and that mask removal and replacement be done in a careful and deliberate manner. Prioritize facemasks for selected activities such as: Exclude HCP at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 from contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients. \nDuring severe resource limitations, consider excluding HCP who may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, such as those of older age, those with chronic medical conditions, or those who may be pregnant, from caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Designate convalescent HCP for provision of care to known or suspected COVID-19 patients. \nIt may be possible to designate HCP who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 to preferentially provide care for additional patients with COVID-19. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection may have developed some protective immunity, but this has not yet been confirmed. Use a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face with no facemask.  Consider use of expedient patient isolation rooms for risk reduction. \nPortable fan devices with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration that are carefully placed can increase the effective air changes per hour of clean air to the patient room, reducing risk to individuals entering the room without respiratory protection. NIOSH has developed guidance for using portable HEPA filtration systems to create expedient patient isolation rooms. The expedient patient isolation room approach involves establishing a high-ventilation-rate, negative pressure, inner isolation zone that sits within a clean larger ventilated zone. Consider use of ventilated headboards \nNIOSH has developed the ventilated headboard that draws exhaled air from a patient in bed into a HEPA filter, decreasing risk of HCP exposure to patient-generated aerosol. This technology consists of lightweight, sturdy, and adjustable aluminum framing with a retractable plastic canopy. The ventilated headboard can be deployed in combination with HEPA fan/filter units to provide surge isolation capacity within a variety of environments, from traditional patient rooms to triage stations, and emergency medical shelters. HCP use of homemade masks: \nIn settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option.

Purpose:  This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called N95 respirators) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the  Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities. The following strategies are based upon these assumptions: 1) facilities understand their current N95 respirator inventory and supply chain, 2) facilities understand their N95 respirators utilization rate, and 3) facilities are in communication with state and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) and healthcare coalitions. While these strategies are targeted for optimizing the supply of N95 respirators, some of these strategies may be applicable to optimizing the supply of other personal protective equipment such as gowns, gloves, and eye protection. Controlling exposures to occupational hazards is a fundamental way to protect personnel. Conventionally, a hierarchy has been used to achieve feasible and effective controls. Multiple control strategies can be implemented concurrently and or sequentially. This hierarchy can be represented as follows: To prevent infectious disease transmission, elimination (physically removing the hazard) and substitution (replacing the hazard) are not typically options for the healthcare setting. However, exposures to transmissible respiratory pathogens in healthcare facilities can often be reduced or possibly avoided through engineering and administrative controls and PPE. Prompt detection and effective triage and isolation of potentially infectious patients are essential to prevent unnecessary exposures among patients, healthcare personnel (HCP), and visitors at the facility. N95 respirators are the PPE most often used to control exposures to infections transmitted via the airborne route, though their effectiveness is highly dependent upon proper fit and use. The optimal way to prevent airborne transmission is to use a combination of interventions from across the hierarchy of controls, not just PPE alone. Applying a combination of controls can provide an additional degree of protection, even if one intervention fails or is not available. Respirators, when required to protect HCP from airborne contaminants such as infectious agents, must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that meets the requirements of  OSHAs Respiratory Protection standard external icon .

If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Share resources with the school community to help them understand COVID-19 and steps they can take to protect themselves: Work with your local health officials to determine a set of strategies appropriate for your communitys situation. Continue using the preparedness strategies implemented for no community transmission, and consider the following social distancing strategies: If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for their college or university. Similar strategies will extend across organizations (e.g., K-12 schools, business, community and faith-based organizations) in a collective effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Measures will likely include extended class suspension and event/activity cancellations (e.g., suspension/cancellations for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended class suspensions, cancel extracurricular group activities and large events. Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education, research, and housing as well as meal programs and other essential services for students. You should establish procedures for anyone who becomes sick or arrives sick on campus. Sick students, staff and faculty should be separated from others, given a mask to wear, if available and sent to their place or residence as soon as possible. Sick residents of on-campus housing should avoid contact with individuals who are healthy. Immediately notify local health officials. These officials will help administrators determine a course of action for your college or university. Administrators should work closely with their local health officials to determine if a short-term closure (for 2-5 days) of all campus buildings and facilities is needed. In some cases, you may only need to close buildings and facilities that had been entered by the individual(s) with COVID-19. This initial short-term class suspension and event and activity (e.g., club meetings; on-campus sport, theater, and music events) cancellation allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation and for custodial staff to clean and disinfect the affected facilities. It also allows the local health officials and administrators to determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19. As you plan and prepare, you should reinforce healthy practices to everyone on campus and prepare for a potential case of COVID-19, regardless of the level of community transmission. As you create and update your preparedness plans, work with your local health officials to determine the most appropriate plan and action for your college or university. Together, you will need to consider your local community situationwhether you have local transmission in your community, and if so, the level of transmission (none/minimal, minimal to moderate, substantial). CDC has created guidance for the scenarios listed below, to help colleges, universities and their partners understand how to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 within their campus, and to react quickly should a case be identified.

This interim guidance is intended for administrators of public and private institutions of higher education (IHE). IHE include a diverse set of American colleges and universities: 2- or 4-year; public, private non-profit, or private for-profit; and comprehensive, research-focused, or special mission. IHE administrators (e.g., presidents, deans, provosts) are individuals who make policies and procedures, set educational aims and standards, and direct programming of institutions of higher education. This guidance will help IHE and their partners understand how to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 among students, faculty, and staff. It also aims to help IHE react quickly should a case be identified in the IHE or if there is spread within the community in which the IHE is located. The guidance includes considerations to help administrators plan for the continuity of teaching, learning, and research if there is community spread of COVID-19 and address concerns related to COVID-19 associated stigma. IHE, working together with local health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of disease. IHEs efforts will help ensure students, staff, and faculty have safe and healthy environments in which to learn and work. IHE welcome students, staff, faculty, and visitors from throughout the community. All of these people may have close contact in IHE settings, often sharing spaces, equipment, and supplies. Some individuals are experiencing stigma and discrimination in the United States related to COVID-19. This includes people of Chinese and Asian descent, as well as some returning travelers and emergency responders who may have been exposed to the virus. It is important for IHE to provide accurate and timely information about COVID-19 to students, staff, and faculty to minimize the potential for stigma on college and university campuses. It is also important to provide mental health support to promote resilience among those groups affected by stigma regarding COVID-19. CDC has  information IHE can share to reduce COVID-19 associated fear and stigma. IHE should be prepared for COVID-19 outbreaks in their local communities and for individual exposure events to occur in facilities, regardless of the level of community transmission, for example, a case associated with travel. The following decision tree can be used to help IHE administrators determine which set of mitigation strategies may be most appropriate for their current situation. Any IHE in any community might need to implement short-term building closure procedures regardless of community spread  if an infected person has been on campus . If this happens, CDC recommends the following procedures, regardless of level of community spread: Coordinate with local health officials . Once learning of a COVID-19 case in someone who has been on the campus, immediately reach out to local public health officials. These officials will help administrators determine a course of action for their IHE. Work with local public health officials to determine cancellation of classes and closure of buildings and facilities.  IHE administrators should work closely with their local health officials to determine if a short-term closure (for 2-5 days) of all campus buildings and facilities is needed. In some cases, IHE administrators, working with local health officials, may choose to only close buildings and facilities that had been entered by the individual(s) with COVID-19. This initial short-term class suspension and event and activity (e.g., club meetings; on-campus sport, theater, and music events) cancellation allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting the IHE. This allows the local health officials to help the IHE determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19. Communicate with students, staff, and faculty.  Coordinate with local health officials to communicate dismissal decisions and the possible COVID-19 exposure. Clean and disinfect thoroughly. Make decisions about extending the class suspension and event and activity cancellation.  Temporarily suspending classes is a strategy to stop or slow the further spread of COVID-19 in communities. Implement strategies to continue education and other related supports for students. The most important thing to do now is  plan and prepare . IHE administrators should reinforce healthy practices among their students, staff, and faculty. As the global outbreak evolves, IHE should prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks in their communities. IHE need to  be ready  in the event COVID-19 does appear in their communities. Here are some strategies: Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOPs).  This should be done in collaboration with local public health departments, the IHEs university system, and other relevant partners. Focus on components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks. Develop information-sharing systems with partners. Reinforce healthy hygiene practices.  Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts. Monitor and plan for absenteeism. Assess group gatherings and events. Consider postponing non-critical gatherings and events.  Require sick students, staff, and faculty to stay home. Establish procedures for students, staff, and faculty who are sick (with any illness) on campus. Ensure IHE health clinics prepare for COVID-19. Create plans to communicate accurate and timely information to the IHE community. Review CDCs guidance for businesses and employers. IHE administrators can support their IHE community by sharing COVID-19 informational resources  with students, staff, and faculty. Coordinate with local health officials to determine what type of information is best to share with the IHE community. Consider sharing the following fact sheets and  information sources : Information about COVID-19 available through  state  and  local external icon health departments General fact sheets to help students, staff, faculty, and their families understand COVID-19 and the steps they can take to protect themselves: CDC information for students, staff, and faculty who have recently traveled back to the United States from areas where CDC has identified community spread of COVID-19: For guidance for  students, staff, or faculty who plan to travel, or have recently traveled, to areas with community spread of COVID-19,  refer to CDCs  FAQ for travelers  and COVID-19 travel  website . Students returning from travel to areas with community spread of COVID-19 must follow guidance they have received from health officials. For specific guidance on  foreign exchange and study abroad programs, see CDCs  guidance on student foreign travel for IHE .   IHE can also consult with state and local public health officials.  IHE may need to postpone or cancel trips that could expose students and staff to potential community spread of COVID-19. If local health officials report that there are multiple cases in the community, IHE may need to implement additional strategies in response to prevent spread in the IHE, but they should continue using the strategies they implemented when there was no community transmission. These additional strategies include: Coordinate with local public health officials.  This should be a first step in making decisions about responses to the presence of COVID-19 in the community. Health officials can help an IHE determine which set of strategies might be most appropriate for their specific communitys situation. Implement multiple social distancing strategies . Select strategies based on feasibility given the unique space and needs on IHE campuses. Not all strategies will be feasible for all IHE. IHE administrators are encouraged to think creatively about all opportunities to increase the physical space between students and limit interactions in large group settings. IHE may consider strategies such as: Consider ways to accommodate the needs of students and staff at  higher risk  of severe illness with COVID-19 .  Consider if and how to honor requests of students or staff who may have concerns about being on campus due to underlying medical conditions or those of others in their home. Ensure continuity of safe housing. Help counter  stigma  and promote resilience on campus. Additional strategies should be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community in addition to those implemented when there is no, minimal, or moderate transmission. These strategies include: Continue to coordinate with local public health officials.  If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for IHE. Mitigation strategies are expected to extend across organizations (e.g., K-12 schools, business, community and faith-based organizations) within the community, as they are not necessarily tied to cases within IHE. Consider extended in-person class suspension.  In collaboration with local public health officials, implement extended class suspension and event/activity cancellations (e.g., suspension/cancellations for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended class suspensions, also cancel extracurricular group activities and large events. Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education, research, and housing as well as meal programs and other essential services for students. This interim guidance is intended for administrators of public and private institutions of higher education (IHE).

Health officials can help an IHE determine which set of strategies might be most appropriate for their specific communitys situation. Implement multiple social distancing strategies . Select strategies based on feasibility given the unique space and needs on IHE campuses. Not all strategies will be feasible for all IHE. IHE administrators are encouraged to think creatively about all opportunities to increase the physical space between students and limit interactions in large group settings. IHE may consider strategies such as: Consider ways to accommodate the needs of students and staff at  higher risk  of severe illness with COVID-19 .  Consider if and how to honor requests of students or staff who may have concerns about being on campus due to underlying medical conditions or those of others in their home. Ensure continuity of safe housing. Help counter  stigma  and promote resilience on campus. Additional strategies should be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community in addition to those implemented when there is no, minimal, or moderate transmission. These strategies include: Continue to coordinate with local public health officials.  If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for IHE. Mitigation strategies are expected to extend across organizations (e.g., K-12 schools, business, community and faith-based organizations) within the community, as they are not necessarily tied to cases within IHE. Consider extended in-person class suspension.  In collaboration with local public health officials, implement extended class suspension and event/activity cancellations (e.g., suspension/cancellations for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended class suspensions, also cancel extracurricular group activities and large events. Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education, research, and housing as well as meal programs and other essential services for students. This interim guidance is intended for administrators of public and private institutions of higher education (IHE). IHE include a diverse set of American colleges and universities: 2- or 4-year; public, private non-profit, or private for-profit; and comprehensive, research-focused, or special mission. IHE administrators (e.g., presidents, deans, provosts) are individuals who make policies and procedures, set educational aims and standards, and direct programming of institutions of higher education.

This guidance will help IHE and their partners understand how to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 among students, faculty, and staff. It also aims to help IHE react quickly should a case be identified in the IHE or if there is spread within the community in which the IHE is located. The guidance includes considerations to help administrators plan for the continuity of teaching, learning, and research if there is community spread of COVID-19 and address concerns related to COVID-19 associated stigma.

IHE, working together with local health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of disease. IHEs efforts will help ensure students, staff, and faculty have safe and healthy environments in which to learn and work. IHE welcome students, staff, faculty, and visitors from throughout the community. All of these people may have close contact in IHE settings, often sharing spaces, equipment, and supplies. Some individuals are experiencing stigma and discrimination in the United States related to COVID-19. This includes people of Chinese and Asian descent, as well as some returning travelers and emergency responders who may have been exposed to the virus. It is important for IHE to provide accurate and timely information about COVID-19 to students, staff, and faculty to minimize the potential for stigma on college and university campuses. It is also important to provide mental health support to promote resilience among those groups affected by stigma regarding COVID-19. CDC has  information IHE can share to reduce COVID-19 associated fear and stigma. IHE, working together with local health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of disease.

IHE should be prepared for COVID-19 outbreaks in their local communities and for individual exposure events to occur in facilities, regardless of the level of community transmission, for example, a case associated with travel. The following decision tree can be used to help IHE administrators determine which set of mitigation strategies may be most appropriate for their current situation.

The following decision tree can be used to help IHE administrators determine which set of mitigation strategies may be most appropriate for their current situation. Any IHE in any community might need to implement short-term building closure procedures regardless of community spread  if an infected person has been on campus . If this happens, CDC recommends the following procedures, regardless of level of community spread: Coordinate with local health officials . Once learning of a COVID-19 case in someone who has been on the campus, immediately reach out to local public health officials. These officials will help administrators determine a course of action for their IHE. Work with local public health officials to determine cancellation of classes and closure of buildings and facilities.  IHE administrators should work closely with their local health officials to determine if a short-term closure (for 2-5 days) of all campus buildings and facilities is needed. In some cases, IHE administrators, working with local health officials, may choose to only close buildings and facilities that had been entered by the individual(s) with COVID-19. This initial short-term class suspension and event and activity (e.g., club meetings; on-campus sport, theater, and music events) cancellation allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting the IHE. This allows the local health officials to help the IHE determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19. Communicate with students, staff, and faculty.  Coordinate with local health officials to communicate dismissal decisions and the possible COVID-19 exposure. Clean and disinfect thoroughly. Make decisions about extending the class suspension and event and activity cancellation.  Temporarily suspending classes is a strategy to stop or slow the further spread of COVID-19 in communities.

IHE administrators should reinforce healthy practices among their students, staff, and faculty. As the global outbreak evolves, IHE should prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks in their communities. IHE need to  be ready  in the event COVID-19 does appear in their communities. Here are some strategies: Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOPs).  This should be done in collaboration with local public health departments, the IHEs university system, and other relevant partners. Focus on components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks. Develop information-sharing systems with partners. Reinforce healthy hygiene practices.  Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts. Monitor and plan for absenteeism. Assess group gatherings and events. Consider postponing non-critical gatherings and events.  Require sick students, staff, and faculty to stay home. Establish procedures for students, staff, and faculty who are sick (with any illness) on campus. Ensure IHE health clinics prepare for COVID-19. Create plans to communicate accurate and timely information to the IHE community. Review CDCs guidance for businesses and employers.

Additional strategies should be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community in addition to those implemented when there is no, minimal, or moderate transmission. These strategies include: Continue to coordinate with local public health officials.  If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for IHE. Mitigation strategies are expected to extend across organizations (e.g., K-12 schools, business, community and faith-based organizations) within the community, as they are not necessarily tied to cases within IHE. Consider extended in-person class suspension.  In collaboration with local public health officials, implement extended class suspension and event/activity cancellations (e.g., suspension/cancellations for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended class suspensions, also cancel extracurricular group activities and large events. Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education, research, and housing as well as meal programs and other essential services for students. Additional strategies should be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community in addition to those implemented when there is no, minimal, or moderate transmission. These strategies include: Continue to coordinate with local public health officials.  If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for IHE. Mitigation strategies are expected to extend across organizations (e.g., K-12 schools, business, community and faith-based organizations) within the community, as they are not necessarily tied to cases within IHE. Consider extended in-person class suspension.  In collaboration with local public health officials, implement extended class suspension and event/activity cancellations (e.g., suspension/cancellations for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community.

As you create and update your preparedness plans, work with your local health officials to determine the most appropriate plan and actions for your school or program. Together, you will need to consider your local community situationwhether you have local transmission in your community, and if so, the level of transmission (none/minimal, minimal to moderate, substantial). CDC has created overall guidance, as well as guidance tailored for transmission level in your area to help child care programs, schools, and their partners understand how to help prevent COVID-19 and react quickly when a case is identified. The guidance includes information about the following: See CDCs full interim guidance for more details. Encourage students and staff to take  everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses. These actions include staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if they are visibly dirty. Remember to supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol. The most important thing you can do now is to prepare.

Focus on the components or annexes of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks. Work with your local health officials to determine a set of strategies appropriate for your communitys situation. Continue using the preparedness strategies implemented for no community transmission, and consider the following social distancing strategies: If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for child care programs or schools. These strategies are expected to extend across multiple programs, schools, or school districts within the community. You may need to consider extended school dismissals (e.g. dismissals for longer than 2 weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended school dismissals, also cancel extracurricular group activities, school-based afterschool programs, and large events (e.g., assemblies, spirit nights, field trips, and sporting events). Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education (e.g., distance learning) as well as meal programs and other essential services for students. Schools and child care programs are  not expected  to screen children, students, or staff to identify cases of COVID-19. If a community (or more specifically, a school) has cases of COVID-19, local health officials will help identify those individuals and follow up on next steps. Share resources with the school community to help them understand COVID-19 and steps they can take to protect themselves: If your school notices a substantial increase in the number of students or staff missing school due to illness, report this to your local health officials. You should establish procedures to ensure students and staff who become sick at school or who arrive at school sick are sent home as soon as possible. Keep anyone sick separate from well students and staff until the  sick person can be sent home . Immediately notify local health officials. These officials will help administrators determine a course of action for their child care programs or schools. You will likely dismiss students and most staff for 2-5 days. This initial short-term dismissal allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting the school and for custodial staff to clean and disinfect the affected facilities. Work with the local health officials to determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended dismissal duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19.

Please check the  CDC COVID-19 website  periodically for updated interim guidance. Health officials are currently taking steps to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 into US communities. Schools play an important role in this effort. Through collaboration and coordination with local health departments, schools should take steps to disseminate information about the disease and its potential transmission within their school community. Schools should prepare to take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among their students and staff should local health officials identify such a need. Schools should continue to collaborate, share information, and review plans with local health officials to help protect the whole school community, including those with special health needs. School plans should be designed to complement other community mitigation strategies to protect high risk populations and the healthcare system, and minimize disruption to teaching and learning and protect students and staff from social stigma and discrimination. Plans should build on everyday practices (e.g., encouraging hand hygiene, monitoring absenteeism, communicating routinely) that include strategies for  before ,  during , and  after  a possible outbreak.

Schools should prepare to take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among their students and staff should local health officials identify such a need. Schools should continue to collaborate, share information, and review plans with local health officials to help protect the whole school community, including those with special health needs. School plans should be designed to complement other community mitigation strategies to protect high risk populations and the healthcare system, and minimize disruption to teaching and learning and protect students and staff from social stigma and discrimination. Plans should build on everyday practices (e.g., encouraging hand hygiene, monitoring absenteeism, communicating routinely) that include strategies for  before ,  during , and  after  a possible outbreak. This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the  CDC COVID-19 website  periodically for updated interim guidance. Health officials are currently taking steps to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 into US communities.

This interim guidance is intended for administrators of public and private child care programs and K-12 schools. Administrators are individuals who oversee the daily operations of child care programs and K-12 schools, and may include positions like child care program directors, school district superintendents, principals, and assistant principals. This guidance is intended for administrators at both the school/facility and district level. This guidance will help child care programs, schools, and their partners understand how to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 within child care and school communities and facilities. It also aims to help child care programs, schools, and partners react quickly should a case be identified. The guidance includes considerations to help administrators plan for the continuity of teaching and learning if there is community spread of COVID-19. Schools, working together with local health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of diseases to help ensure students have safe and healthy learning environments. Schools serve students, staff, and visitors from throughout the community. All of these people may have close contact in the school setting, often sharing spaces, equipment, and supplies. Information about  COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but the information that is available suggests that children with confirmed COVID-19 generally had mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. People who have serious chronic medical conditions are believed to be at higher risk. Despite lower risk of serious illness among most children, children with COVID-19-like symptoms should avoid contact with others who might be at higher risk, such as  older adults and adults with serious chronic medical conditions . Schools should be prepared for COVID-19 outbreaks in their local communities and for individual exposure events to occur in their facilities, regardless of the level of community transmission, for example a case associated with recent travel to an area with sustained COVID-19 transmission. The following decision tree can be used to help schools determine which set of mitigation strategies may be most appropriate for their current situation. Any school in any community might need to implement short-term closure procedures regardless of community spread  if an infected person has been in a school building . If this happens, CDC recommends the following procedures regardless of the level of community spread: Coordinate with local health officials.  Once learning of a COVID-19 case in someone who has been in the school, immediately notify local health officials. These officials will help administrators determine a course of action for their child care programs or schools. Dismiss students and most staff for 2-5 days.  This initial short-term dismissal allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting the school. This allows the local health officials to help the school determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended dismissal duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19. Communicate with staff, parents, and students.  Coordinate with local health officials to communicate dismissal decisions and the possible COVID-19 exposure. Clean and disinfect thoroughly. Make decisions about extending the school dismissal.  Temporarily dismissing child care programs and K-12 schools is a strategy to stop or slow the further spread of COVID-19 in communities. Implement strategies to continue education and related supports for students. The most important thing to do now is  plan and prepare . Administrators should reinforce healthy practices among their students and staff. As the global outbreak evolves, schools should prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks. Schools need to  be ready  if COVID-19 does appear in their communities. Here are some strategies: Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOPs).  This should be done in collaboration with  local health departments external icon  and other relevant partners. Focus on the components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks. Develop information-sharing systems with partners. Teach and reinforce healthy hygiene practices. Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts. Monitor and plan for absenteeism. Assess group gatherings and events. Consider postponing non-critical gatherings and events.  Require sick students and staff to stay home. Establish procedures for students and staff who are sick at school. Create and test communications plans for use with the school community. Review CDCs guidance   for businesses and employers . Child care and K-12 administrators can support their school community by sharing resources with students (if resources are age-appropriate), their families, and staff. Coordinate with local health officials to determine what type of information might be best to share with the school community. Consider sharing the following fact sheets and information sources: For questions about students who plan to travel, or have recently traveled, to areas with community spread of COVID-19, refer to CDCs  FAQ for travelers . Schools can also consult with state and local health officials.  Schools may need to postpone or cancel trips that could expose students and staff to potential community spread of COVID-19. Students returning from travel to areas with community spread of COVID-19 must follow guidance they have received from health officials. COVID-19 information for travel is updated regularly on the CDC  website . If local health officials report that there are multiple cases of COVID-19 in the community, schools may need to implement additional strategies in response to prevent spread in the school, but they should continue using the strategies they implemented when there was no community transmission. These additional strategies include: Coordinate with local health officials.  This should be a first step in making decisions about responses to the presence of COVID-19 in the community. Health officials can help a school determine which set of strategies might be most appropriate for their specific communitys situation. Implement multiple social distancing strategies.  Select strategies based on feasibility given the unique space and needs of the school. Not all strategies will be feasible for all schools. For example, limiting hall movement options can be particularly challenging in secondary schools. Many strategies that are feasible in primary or secondary schools may be less feasible in child care settings. Administrators are encouraged to think creatively about all opportunities to increase the physical space between students and limit interactions in large group settings. Schools may consider strategies such as: Consider ways to accommodate the needs of children and families at  risk  for serious illness from COVID-19 .  Consider if and how to honor requests of parents who may have concerns about their children attending school due to underlying medical conditions of their children or others in their home. Additional information about social distancing, including information on its use for other viral illnesses, is available in this  CDC publication pdf icon . Additional strategies should be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community in addition to those implemented when there is no, minimal, or moderate transmission. These strategies include: Continue to coordinate with local health officials.  If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for child care programs or schools. These strategies are expected to extend across multiple programs, schools, or school districts within the community, as they are not necessarily tied to cases within schools or child care facilities. Consider extended school dismissals.  In collaboration with local health officials, implement extended school dismissals (e.g., dismissals for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended school dismissals, also cancel extracurricular group activities, school-based afterschool programs, and large events (e.g., assemblies, spirit nights, field trips, and sporting events). Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education (e.g., distance learning) as well as meal programs and other essential services for students.

If local health officials report that there are multiple cases of COVID-19 in the community, schools may need to implement additional strategies in response to prevent spread in the school, but they should continue using the strategies they implemented when there was no community transmission. These additional strategies include: Coordinate with local health officials.  This should be a first step in making decisions about responses to the presence of COVID-19 in the community. Health officials can help a school determine which set of strategies might be most appropriate for their specific communitys situation. Implement multiple social distancing strategies.  Select strategies based on feasibility given the unique space and needs of the school. Not all strategies will be feasible for all schools. For example, limiting hall movement options can be particularly challenging in secondary schools. Many strategies that are feasible in primary or secondary schools may be less feasible in child care settings. Administrators are encouraged to think creatively about all opportunities to increase the physical space between students and limit interactions in large group settings. Schools may consider strategies such as: Consider ways to accommodate the needs of children and families at  risk  for serious illness from COVID-19 .

Additional strategies should be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community in addition to those implemented when there is no, minimal, or moderate transmission. These strategies include: Continue to coordinate with local health officials.  If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they will provide guidance to administrators on the best course of action for child care programs or schools. These strategies are expected to extend across multiple programs, schools, or school districts within the community, as they are not necessarily tied to cases within schools or child care facilities. Consider extended school dismissals.  In collaboration with local health officials, implement extended school dismissals (e.g., dismissals for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. During extended school dismissals, also cancel extracurricular group activities, school-based afterschool programs, and large events (e.g., assemblies, spirit nights, field trips, and sporting events). Remember to implement strategies to ensure the continuity of education (e.g., distance learning) as well as meal programs and other essential services for students.

A: All laboratories should perform a site-specific and activity-specific risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks and determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs, such as high testing volumes, and the likelihood to generate infectious droplets and aerosols. Risk assessments and mitigation measures are dependent on the procedures performed, identification of the hazards involved in the process and/or procedures, the competency level of the personnel who perform the procedures, the laboratory equipment and facility, and the resources available. The risk assessment should identify all potential scenarios of a particular activity that could produce a negative outcome. The risk assessment should prioritize those potential negative outcomes, or risks, based on an evaluation of the likelihood and consequences of each of those identified risks. The risk assessment should determine the most appropriate control measures, and how the system will measure the effectiveness of those control measures.

Standard Precautions include hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, and eye protection. For additional information, refer to the following: \n  2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings pdf icon \n  CDC Isolation Precautions Q: What are infectious aerosols and droplets? \nA:  Aerosols and droplets  containing particles that are <100 m in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. Laboratory workers may not be aware that such particles can be generated during many laboratory procedures and that these particles could be inhaled or could cross-contaminate work surfaces, materials, and equipment. Infectious aerosols  are small liquid or solid particles suspended in the air that contain infectious agents. They can disperse throughout the laboratory and remain infective over time and distance. These particles are of a size that may be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract (<5 m in diameter). Examples of organisms transmitted by aerosols include spores of Aspergillus spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rubeola virus (measles), and varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox). Droplets  traditionally are defined as larger infectious particles (>5 m in diameter) that rapidly fall out of the air, contaminating gloves, the immediate work area, and the mucous membranes of the persons performing the procedure. Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the droplet route include Bordetella pertussis, influenza viruses, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), group A streptococcus, and Neisseria meningitidis. For additional information, refer to the following: \n  WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, 3rd pdf icon external icon \n  2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings pdf icon \n  CDC Isolation Precautions Q: What procedures can generate aerosols and droplets? \nA: Many routine laboratory procedures can potentially generate aerosols and droplets that are often undetectable.

Standard Precautions include hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, and eye protection. For additional information, refer to the following: \n  2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings pdf icon \n  CDC Isolation Precautions Q: What are infectious aerosols and droplets? \nA:  Aerosols and droplets  containing particles that are <100 m in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. Laboratory workers may not be aware that such particles can be generated during many laboratory procedures and that these particles could be inhaled or could cross-contaminate work surfaces, materials, and equipment. Infectious aerosols  are small liquid or solid particles suspended in the air that contain infectious agents. They can disperse throughout the laboratory and remain infective over time and distance. These particles are of a size that may be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract (<5 m in diameter). Examples of organisms transmitted by aerosols include spores of Aspergillus spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rubeola virus (measles), and varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox). Droplets  traditionally are defined as larger infectious particles (>5 m in diameter) that rapidly fall out of the air, contaminating gloves, the immediate work area, and the mucous membranes of the persons performing the procedure. Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the droplet route include Bordetella pertussis, influenza viruses, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), group A streptococcus, and Neisseria meningitidis. For additional information, refer to the following: \n  WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, 3rd pdf icon external icon \n  2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings pdf icon \n  CDC Isolation Precautions Q: What procedures can generate aerosols and droplets? \nA: Many routine laboratory procedures can potentially generate aerosols and droplets that are often undetectable. The following laboratory procedures have been associated with the generation of infectious aerosols and droplets: centrifugation, pipetting, vortexing, mixing, shaking, sonicating, removing caps, decanting liquids, preparing smears, flaming slides, aliquoting and loading specimens, loading syringes, manipulating needles, syringes or sharps, aspirating and transferring blood and body fluids, subculturing blood culture bottles, spilling specimens, and cleaning up spills.

Cancel all public or non-essential group activities and events. For essential group activities that cannot be canceled, implementing the following social distancing measures can help: Because canceling social interaction may increase risk of adverse mental health outcomes, particularly during a stressful event of a disease outbreak, administrators can provide information to help support residents in  managing stress and anxiety during this COVID-19 outbreak. Clean and disinfect all common areas and shared facilities. Inform residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors about COVID-19. Sharing the facts  about COVID-19 and ensuring that residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors are aware of the  symptoms of COVID-19 , health conditions that may put them at  higher risk  of becoming very sick with COVID-19, its health risks, and  what to do if they become ill can make an outbreak less stressful and help prevent or slow the spread of disease. Administrators can support residents who have no or limited access to the internet by Encourage personal protective measures Workers, contractors (such as barbers, hairdressers, sitters, and housekeepers), and volunteers providing care in multiple homes or facilities can serve as a source of coronavirus transmission between residences in these facilities. These persons should be advised to limit the number of people they interact with who are at higherrisk of serious complications from COVID-19, and retain distance of >6 feet when interacting. Help residents establish a buddy system to ensure they stay connected. Owners, administrators, and operators of retirement communities and ILF may want to identify residents who have unique medical needs (including behavioral health needs), and access and functional needs to encourage them to develop a plan if they or their primary caretaker(s) become ill. They can assist in finding volunteers to assist residents who may need extra assistance in getting the medical help they need and train these volunteers in following  personal protective measures . These volunteers should not be persons who are at  higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 . Volunteers can also consider checking up on residents via electronic means if appropriate. Consider limiting the number of non-essential visitors.

This guidance is intended to provide key actions that local and state health departments, homelessness service systems, housing authorities, emergency planners, healthcare facilities, and homeless outreach services can take to protect people experiencing homelessness from the spread of COVID-19. People experiencing unsheltered homelessness (those sleeping outside or in places not meant for human habitation) may be at risk for infection when there is community spread of COVID-19. This interim guidance is intended to support response planning by local and state health departments, homelessness service systems, housing authorities, emergency planners, healthcare facilities, and homeless outreach services. Homeless shelters and other facilities should also refer to the  Interim Guidance for Homeless Shelters . Community and faith-based organizations can refer to the  Interim Guidance for Community and Faith-based Organizations for other information related to their staff and organizations. COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus. There is much to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features of the disease. Everyone can do their part to help plan, prepare, and respond to this emerging public health threat. Lack of housing contributes to poor health outcomes, and linkage to permanent housing should continue to be a priority. In the context of COVID-19, the risks associated with sleeping outdoors in an encampment setting are different than with staying indoors in a congregate setting such as an emergency shelter or other congregate living facility. Outdoor settings may allow people to increase distance between themselves and others. However, sleeping outdoors often does not provide protection from the environment, quick access to hygiene and sanitation facilities, or connection to healthcare. The balance of risks should be considered for each individual experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Reaching and protecting people experiencing unsheltered homelessness during the COVID-19 outbreak will require coordination across several local sectors. To prevent negative outcomes from lack of services, community leaders should continue activities that protect people experiencing homelessness, including supporting continuity of homeless services, healthcare, behavioral health services, food pantries, and linkages to permanent housing. Plans need to be clearly communicated to all stakeholders. Encampments : Communications : Provide straightforward communications to people sleeping outside in the appropriate language. Identify people who are influential in the community who can help communicate with others. Post signs in strategic locations to provide information on hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette. Request up-to-date contact information for each person. Information to share includes: Some people who are experiencing unsheltered homelessness may be at higher risk of moderate to severe disease because of  certain conditions . Pay particular attention to preventing disease among these individuals. Local partners should plan for where individuals and families with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experiencing unsheltered homelessness can safely stay. These should include places where people who are confirmed to be positive and those awaiting test results can be isolated. Additionally, if a person needs to be hospitalized, a plan should be in place for how they will safely recover after discharge. Ideally, these individuals will be housed for the duration necessary, as outlined in the  recommendations for discontinuation of isolation . Isolation housing could be units designated by local authorities or shelters determined to have capacity to sufficiently isolate these individuals. If medical care is not necessary and if no other options are available, advise the individual on how to isolate themselves while efforts are underway to provide additional support. In each scenario, identify how to safely transport patients to and from healthcare and housing facilities. Behavioral health teams should be involved in the planning for these sites to facilitate continued access to support for people with substance abuse or mental health disorders. In some situations, for example due to severe untreated mental illness, an individual may not be able to comply with isolation recommendations. In these cases, community leaders should consult local health authorities to determine alternative options. A local surge in the need for medical care may require jurisdictions to establish isolation sites and alternate care sites (ACS) where patients with COVID-19 can remain for the duration of their isolation period. These are typically established in non-traditional environments, such as converted hotels or mobile field medical units. Isolation sites are intended to be locations for patients who do not require medical care, while ACS are intended be locations for patients who require some degree of medical care. Isolation sites can be used for people with COVID-19 who are currently experiencing homelessness and cannot be discharged to a congregate setting.

At present clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care, including supplementary oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated. An array of drugs approved for other indications as well as several investigational drugs are being studied in several hundred clinical trials that are underway across the globe. The purpose of this document is to provide information on two of the approved drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) and one of the investigational agents (remdesivir) currently in use in the United States. Remdesivir is an investigational intravenous drug with broad antiviral activity that inhibits viral replication through premature termination of RNA transcription and has in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and in-vitro and in-vivo activity against related betacoronaviruses  [ 1-3 ] . There are currently four options for obtaining remdesivir for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia in the United States: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are oral prescription drugs that have been used for treatment of malaria and certain inflammatory conditions. Chloroquine has been used for malaria treatment and chemoprophylaxis, and hydroxychloroquine is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyria cutanea tarda. Both drugs have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, with hydroxychloroquine having relatively higher potency against SARS-CoV-2  [ 1,4,5 ] . A study in China reported that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group, and chloroquine was added as a recommended antiviral for treatment of COVID-19 in China  [ 6 ] . Based upon limited in-vitro and anecdotal data, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are currently recommended for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in several countries. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have known safety profiles with the main concerns being cardiotoxicity (prolonged QT syndrome) with prolonged use in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and immunosuppression but have been reportedly well-tolerated in COVID-19 patients. Due to higher in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its wider availability in the United States compared with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine has been administered to hospitalized COVID-19 patients on an uncontrolled basis in multiple countries, including in the United States. One small study reported that hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin reduced detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens compared with a non-randomized control group but did not assess clinical benefit  [ 7 ] . Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are associated with QT prolongation and caution is advised when considering these drugs in patients with chronic medical conditions (e.g. renal failure, hepatic disease) or who are receiving medications that might interact to cause arrythmias. Hydroxychloroquine is currently under investigation in clinical trials for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and treatment of patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. In the United States, several clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection are planned or will be enrolling soon. More information on trials can be found at:  https://clinicaltrials.gov/ external icon . There are no currently available data from Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) to inform clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although optimal dosing and duration of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 are unknown, some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotally different hydroxychloroquine dosing such as: 400mg BID on day one, then daily for 5 days; 400 mg BID on day one, then 200mg BID for 4 days; 600 mg BID on day one, then 400mg daily on days 2-5. Lopinavir-ritonavir did not show promise for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia in a recent clinical trial in China  [ 8 ] . This trial was underpowered, and lopinavir-ritonavir is under investigation in a World Health Organization study.

This guidance is intended to help CFBOs prevent the transmission of COVID-19 within their facilities and communities. CFBOs need to be able to react quickly if there is a confirmed COVID-19 case among staff, volunteers, the people they serve, or visitors. The guidance includes considerations to help administrators and leaders plan for the continuity of services depending on level of community spread of COVID-19. CFBOs, working together with schools, businesses, healthcare systems and state/territorial and local (and, if applicable, tribal) health departments, have an important role in slowing the spread of diseases, especially among high risk populations. It is important to realize that government, communities, and individuals must work together to prepare for and respond to COVID-19. A CFBO is one part of a community, local, regional, and national collaborative effort. CFBOs often serve those who are most vulnerable, such as  older people and those with serious underlying health conditions  like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes  who are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness. This may include members and regular attendees or people they serve as well as persons from the broader community. CFBOs should be prepared for situations when there is local community transmission of COVID-19 and when a confirmed COVID-19 case has been in the facility, regardless of level of community transmission. The following diagram summarizes mitigation strategies that may be most appropriate for these situations. The most important thing to do before community transmission occurs is  plan and prepare . CFBO administrators and leaders should reinforce healthy hygiene practices among their staff, volunteers, members, the people they serve, and visitors. As the global outbreak evolves, CFBOs should prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks. CFBOs need to  be ready  if, and when, COVID-19 appears in their communities.

As the global outbreak evolves, CFBOs should prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks. CFBOs need to  be ready  if, and when, COVID-19 appears in their communities. Here are some strategies: Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOP).  This should be done in collaboration with  local health departments external icon  and other relevant partners. Many CFBOs already have an EOP designed for a wide range or emergencies (e.g., natural disasters, fires). Focus on the components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks. Teach and reinforce healthy hygiene practices. Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts. Monitor and plan for absenteeism. Require sick staff and volunteers to stay home. Determine when to cancel or postpone non-essential gatherings and events. Establish procedures for persons who are sick at the facility. Create and test communications for staff, volunteers, members, and the people you serve. Review CDCs guidance   for businesses and employers . Any CFBO should be prepared to close temporarily, regardless of whether there is community transmission,  if a person who is a confirmed COVID-19 case has been in the facility . If this happens, CDC recommends the following procedures: Coordinate with local health officials.  Once learning of a person with confirmed COVID-19 who has been in the facility, immediately notify local health officials. These officials will have guidance for administrators and leaders to determine a course of action, which may include tracing contacts of that person. Clean and disinfect thoroughly. Implement strategies to continue essential services for the people you serve. Communicate with staff, volunteers, members, and the people you serve.  Coordinate with local health officials to communicate closure decisions, alterations to services, and the possible COVID-19 exposure. CFBOs play a vital role in maintaining community morale and cohesion, especially if large gatherings and other community assemblies are cancelled. People will need to be able to receive timely, reliable information from their religious and community leaders. Make decisions in consultation with local health officials about extending the closure of, or limited access to, the facility.  This is a strategy to stop or slow the further spread of COVID-19 in communities. If local health officials report that there is a minimal to moderate level of COVID-19 transmission in the community, CFBOs need to implement additional strategies in response to prevent spread. These additional strategies include: Coordinate with local health officials.  This should be a first step in making decisions about responses to the presence of COVID-19 in the community. Health officials can help a CFBO determine which set of strategies might be most appropriate for the organizations situation. Continue using strategies   from   the preparedness phase (when there was no community transmission) .  Implement the emergency operations plan, scaling mitigation strategies up or down depending on the evolving local situation. Be aware of school dismissals and other community-wide mitigation strategies in your area because these may affect your staff and volunteers as well as the needs of members and the people you serve. Implement multiple social distancing strategies.  Select strategies based on feasibility given the unique space and needs of the organization. Not all strategies will be appropriate or feasible for all organizations. Administrators and leaders are encouraged to think creatively about all opportunities to increase the physical space between individuals and limit interactions in large group settings. Consider ways to accommodate the needs of individuals at  higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19  in all strategies. Consider alternatives for providing essential services for the people you serve. Consider focusing your organizations efforts to provide services that are most needed during the emergency, such as  mental health , spiritual health, or social services. Enhanced strategies need to be considered when there is substantial transmission in the local community. Continue to coordinate with local health officials.  If local health officials have determined there is substantial transmission of COVID-19 within the community, they can provide guidance on the best course of action for CFBOs. Local public health officials will also provide recommendations for phasing out and ending COVID-19 community mitigation actions at the appropriate time. Cancel or postpone community and faith-based gatherings of any size . If the facility is open, determine which other mitigation strategies (of those recommended to be implemented when there is no transmission or minimal to moderate transmission) need to be scaled up and/or extended.  Consider extended closure of the facility or limited access for non-essential services.  This longer-term strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community, particularly when implemented in coordination with other closures in the community. Remember to implement strategies to ensure continuity of services to the extent possible, while also addressing increased social, emotional, spiritual, physical, and safety needs (e.g., meal programs, spiritual and social support), particularly for groups that may be more highly impacted. Consider how your organization is able to support the local community. Consider focusing your organizations efforts to provide services that are most needed during the emergency, such as  mental health , spiritual health, or social services. Review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOP).  This should be done in collaboration with  local health departments external icon  and other relevant partners. Many CFBOs already have an EOP designed for a wide range or emergencies (e.g., natural disasters, fires). Focus on the components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks. Teach and reinforce healthy hygiene practices. Intensify cleaning and disinfection efforts. Monitor and plan for absenteeism. Require sick staff and volunteers to stay home. Determine when to cancel or postpone non-essential gatherings and events. Establish procedures for persons who are sick at the facility. Create and test communications for staff, volunteers, members, and the people you serve. Review CDCs guidance   for businesses and employers . Any CFBO should be prepared to close temporarily, regardless of whether there is community transmission,  if a person who is a confirmed COVID-19 case has been in the facility . If this happens, CDC recommends the following procedures: Coordinate with local health officials.  Once learning of a person with confirmed COVID-19 who has been in the facility, immediately notify local health officials. These officials will have guidance for administrators and leaders to determine a course of action, which may include tracing contacts of that person. Clean and disinfect thoroughly. Implement strategies to continue essential services for the people you serve. Communicate with staff, volunteers, members, and the people you serve.  Coordinate with local health officials to communicate closure decisions, alterations to services, and the possible COVID-19 exposure. CFBOs play a vital role in maintaining community morale and cohesion, especially if large gatherings and other community assemblies are cancelled. People will need to be able to receive timely, reliable information from their religious and community leaders. Make decisions in consultation with local health officials about extending the closure of, or limited access to, the facility.  This is a strategy to stop or slow the further spread of COVID-19 in communities. If local health officials report that there is a minimal to moderate level of COVID-19 transmission in the community, CFBOs need to implement additional strategies in response to prevent spread. These additional strategies include: Coordinate with local health officials.  This should be a first step in making decisions about responses to the presence of COVID-19 in the community. Health officials can help a CFBO determine which set of strategies might be most appropriate for the organizations situation.

{"scrapedAt": "2020-04-02T02:03:00", "title": "Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities", "publishedAt": "2020-03-23T00:00:00", "content": "Printer friendly version pdf icon This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as of the date of posting, March 23, 2020. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the  CDC website  periodically for updated interim guidance. This document provides interim guidance specific for correctional facilities and detention centers during the outbreak of COVID-19, to ensure continuation of essential public services and protection of the health and safety of incarcerated and detained persons, staff, and visitors. Recommendations may need to be revised as more information becomes available. This document is intended to provide guiding principles for healthcare and non-healthcare administrators of correctional and detention facilities (including but not limited to federal and state prisons, local jails, and detention centers), law enforcement agencies that have custodial authority for detained populations (i.e., US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Marshals Service), and their respective health departments, to assist in preparing for potential introduction, spread, and mitigation of COVID-19 in their facilities. In general, the document uses terminology referring to correctional environments but can also be applied to civil and pre-trial detention settings. This guidance will not necessarily address every possible custodial setting and may not use legal terminology specific to individual agencies authorities or processes . The guidance may need to be adapted based on individual facilities physical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions.  Facilities should contact CDC or their state, local, territorial, and/or tribal public health department if they need assistance in applying these principles or addressing topics that are not specifically covered in this guidance. Correctional and detention facilities can include custody, housing, education, recreation, healthcare, food service, and workplace components in a single physical setting. The integration of these components presents unique challenges for control of COVID-19 transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors. Consistent application of specific preparation, prevention, and management measures can help reduce the risk of transmission and severe disease from COVID-19. CDC has issued separate COVID-19 guidance addressing  healthcare infection control and  clinical care of COVID-19 cases  as well as  close contacts of cases in community-based settings. Where relevant, community-focused guidance documents are referenced in this document and should be monitored regularly for updates, but they may require adaptation for correctional and detention settings. This guidance document provides additional recommended best practices specifically for correctional and detention facilities.  At this time, different facility types (e.g., prison vs. jail) and sizes are not differentiated. Administrators and agencies should adapt these guiding principles to the specific needs of their facility. The guidance below includes detailed recommendations on the following topics related to COVID-19 in correctional and detention settings: Close contact of a COVID-19 case   In the context of COVID-19, an individual is considered a close contact if they a) have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or b) have had direct contact with infectious secretions from a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on). Close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Cohorting   Cohorting refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases together as a group, or quarantining close contacts of a particular case together as a group. Ideally, cases should be isolated individually, and close contacts should be quarantined individually. However, some correctional facilities and detention centers do not have enough individual cells to do so and must consider cohorting as an alternative. See  Quarantine  and  Medical Isolation sections below for specific details about ways to implement cohorting to minimize the risk of disease spread and adverse health outcomes. Community transmission of COVID-19   Community transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals acquire the disease through contact with someone in their local community, rather than through travel to an affected location. Once community transmission is identified in a particular area, correctional facilities and detention centers are more likely to start seeing cases inside their walls. Facilities should consult with local public health departments if assistance is needed in determining how to define local community in the context of COVID-19 spread. However, because all states have reported cases, all facilities should be vigilant for introduction into their populations. Confirmed vs. Suspected COVID-19 case   A  confirmed case  has received a positive result from a COVID-19 laboratory test, with or without symptoms. A  suspected case  shows symptoms of COVID-19 but either has not been tested or is awaiting test results. If test results are positive, a suspected case becomes a confirmed case. Incarcerated/detained persons   For the purpose of this document, incarcerated/detained persons refers to persons held in a prison, jail, detention center, or other custodial setting where these guidelines are generally applicable. The term includes those who have been sentenced (i.e., in prisons) as well as those held for pre-trial (i.e., jails) or civil purposes (i.e, detention centers). Although this guidance does not specifically reference individuals in every type of custodial setting (e.g., juvenile facilities, community confinement facilities), facility administrators can adapt this guidance to apply to their specific circumstances as needed. Medical Isolation   Medical isolation refers to confining a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case (ideally to a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes), to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission. Medical isolation ends when the individual meets pre-established clinical and/or testing criteria for release from isolation, in consultation with clinical providers and public health officials (detailed in guidance  below ). In this context, isolation does NOT refer to punitive isolation for behavioral infractions within the custodial setting. Staff are encouraged to use the term medical isolation to avoid confusion. Quarantine   Quarantine refers to the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a COVID-19 case to determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease. Quarantine for COVID-19 should last for a period of 14 days. Ideally, each quarantined individual would be quarantined in a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes. If symptoms develop during the 14-day period, the individual should be placed under  medical isolation and evaluated for COVID-19. If symptoms do not develop, movement restrictions can be lifted, and the individual can return to their previous residency status within the facility. Social Distancing   Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space between individuals and decreasing the frequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all individuals, even those who are asymptomatic). Social distancing strategies can be applied on an individual level (e.g., avoiding physical contact), a group level (e.g., canceling group activities where individuals will be in close contact), and an operational level (e.g., rearranging chairs in the dining hall to increase distance between them). Although social distancing is challenging to practice in correctional and detention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Additional information about social distancing, including information on its use to reduce the spread of other viral illnesses, is available in this  CDC publication pdf icon . Staff   In this document, staff refers to all public sector employees as well as those working for a private contractor within a correctional facility (e.g., private healthcare or food service). Except where noted, staff does not distinguish between healthcare, custody, and other types of staff including private facility operators. Symptoms    Symptoms of COVID-19  include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Like other respiratory infections, COVID-19 can vary in severity from mild to severe.When severe, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death are possible. COVID-19 is a novel disease, therefore the full range of signs and symptoms, the clinical course of the disease, and the individuals and populations most at risk for disease and complications are not yet fully understood. Monitor the  CDC website  for updates on these topics. Although many large facilities such as prisons and some jails usually employ onsite healthcare staff and have the capacity to evaluate incarcerated/detained persons for potential illness within a dedicated healthcare space, many smaller facilities do not. Some of these facilities have access to on-call healthcare staff or providers who visit the facility every few days. Others have neither onsite healthcare capacity nor onsite medical isolation/quarantine space and must transfer ill patients to other correctional or detention facilities or local hospitals for evaluation and care. The majority of the guidance below is designed to be applied to any correctional or detention facility, either as written or with modifications based on a facilitys individual structure and resources. However, topics related to healthcare evaluation and clinical care of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts may not apply directly to facilities with limited or no onsite healthcare services. It will be especially important for these types of facilities to coordinate closely with their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department when they encounter confirmed or suspected cases among incarcerated/detained persons or staff, in order to ensure effective medical isolation and quarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and medical transfer if needed. The guidance makes note of strategies tailored to facilities without onsite healthcare where possible. Note that all staff in any sized facility, regardless of the presence of onsite healthcare services, should observe guidance on  recommended PPE  in order to ensure their own safety when interacting with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. Facilities should make contingency plans for the likely event of  PPE shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 Guidance for Correctional Facilities Guidance for correctional and detention facilities is organized into 3 sections: Operational Preparedness, Prevention, and Management of COVID-19. Recommendations across these sections can be applied simultaneously based on the progress of the outbreak in a particular facility and the surrounding community. Printer friendly version pdf icon This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as of the date of posting, March 23, 2020. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update this guidance as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the  CDC website  periodically for updated interim guidance. This document provides interim guidance specific for correctional facilities and detention centers during the outbreak of COVID-19, to ensure continuation of essential public services and protection of the health and safety of incarcerated and detained persons, staff, and visitors. Recommendations may need to be revised as more information becomes available. This document is intended to provide guiding principles for healthcare and non-healthcare administrators of correctional and detention facilities (including but not limited to federal and state prisons, local jails, and detention centers), law enforcement agencies that have custodial authority for detained populations (i.e., US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Marshals Service), and their respective health departments, to assist in preparing for potential introduction, spread, and mitigation of COVID-19 in their facilities. In general, the document uses terminology referring to correctional environments but can also be applied to civil and pre-trial detention settings. This guidance will not necessarily address every possible custodial setting and may not use legal terminology specific to individual agencies authorities or processes . The guidance may need to be adapted based on individual facilities physical space, staffing, population, operations, and other resources and conditions.  Facilities should contact CDC or their state, local, territorial, and/or tribal public health department if they need assistance in applying these principles or addressing topics that are not specifically covered in this guidance. Correctional and detention facilities can include custody, housing, education, recreation, healthcare, food service, and workplace components in a single physical setting. The integration of these components presents unique challenges for control of COVID-19 transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors. Consistent application of specific preparation, prevention, and management measures can help reduce the risk of transmission and severe disease from COVID-19. CDC has issued separate COVID-19 guidance addressing  healthcare infection control and  clinical care of COVID-19 cases  as well as  close contacts of cases in community-based settings. Where relevant, community-focused guidance documents are referenced in this document and should be monitored regularly for updates, but they may require adaptation for correctional and detention settings. This guidance document provides additional recommended best practices specifically for correctional and detention facilities.  At this time, different facility types (e.g., prison vs. jail) and sizes are not differentiated. Administrators and agencies should adapt these guiding principles to the specific needs of their facility. The guidance below includes detailed recommendations on the following topics related to COVID-19 in correctional and detention settings: Close contact of a COVID-19 case   In the context of COVID-19, an individual is considered a close contact if they a) have been within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time or b) have had direct contact with infectious secretions from a COVID-19 case (e.g., have been coughed on). Close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a common space with a COVID-19 case. Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Considerations when assessing close contact include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk) and the clinical symptoms of the person with COVID-19 (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk, as does exposure to a severely ill patient). Cohorting   Cohorting refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases together as a group, or quarantining close contacts of a particular case together as a group. Ideally, cases should be isolated individually, and close contacts should be quarantined individually. However, some correctional facilities and detention centers do not have enough individual cells to do so and must consider cohorting as an alternative. See  Quarantine  and  Medical Isolation sections below for specific details about ways to implement cohorting to minimize the risk of disease spread and adverse health outcomes. Community transmission of COVID-19   Community transmission of COVID-19 occurs when individuals acquire the disease through contact with someone in their local community, rather than through travel to an affected location. Once community transmission is identified in a particular area, correctional facilities and detention centers are more likely to start seeing cases inside their walls. Facilities should consult with local public health departments if assistance is needed in determining how to define local community in the context of COVID-19 spread. However, because all states have reported cases, all facilities should be vigilant for introduction into their populations. Confirmed vs. Suspected COVID-19 case   A  confirmed case  has received a positive result from a COVID-19 laboratory test, with or without symptoms. A  suspected case  shows symptoms of COVID-19 but either has not been tested or is awaiting test results. If test results are positive, a suspected case becomes a confirmed case. Incarcerated/detained persons   For the purpose of this document, incarcerated/detained persons refers to persons held in a prison, jail, detention center, or other custodial setting where these guidelines are generally applicable. The term includes those who have been sentenced (i.e., in prisons) as well as those held for pre-trial (i.e., jails) or civil purposes (i.e, detention centers). Although this guidance does not specifically reference individuals in every type of custodial setting (e.g., juvenile facilities, community confinement facilities), facility administrators can adapt this guidance to apply to their specific circumstances as needed. Medical Isolation   Medical isolation refers to confining a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case (ideally to a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes), to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission. Medical isolation ends when the individual meets pre-established clinical and/or testing criteria for release from isolation, in consultation with clinical providers and public health officials (detailed in guidance  below ). In this context, isolation does NOT refer to punitive isolation for behavioral infractions within the custodial setting. Staff are encouraged to use the term medical isolation to avoid confusion. Quarantine   Quarantine refers to the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a COVID-19 case to determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease. Quarantine for COVID-19 should last for a period of 14 days. Ideally, each quarantined individual would be quarantined in a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes. If symptoms develop during the 14-day period, the individual should be placed under  medical isolation and evaluated for COVID-19. If symptoms do not develop, movement restrictions can be lifted, and the individual can return to their previous residency status within the facility. Social Distancing   Social distancing is the practice of increasing the space between individuals and decreasing the frequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading a disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all individuals, even those who are asymptomatic). Social distancing strategies can be applied on an individual level (e.g., avoiding physical contact), a group level (e.g., canceling group activities where individuals will be in close contact), and an operational level (e.g., rearranging chairs in the dining hall to increase distance between them). Although social distancing is challenging to practice in correctional and detention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Additional information about social distancing, including information on its use to reduce the spread of other viral illnesses, is available in this  CDC publication pdf icon . Staff   In this document, staff refers to all public sector employees as well as those working for a private contractor within a correctional facility (e.g., private healthcare or food service). Except where noted, staff does not distinguish between healthcare, custody, and other types of staff including private facility operators. Symptoms    Symptoms of COVID-19  include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Like other respiratory infections, COVID-19 can vary in severity from mild to severe.When severe, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death are possible. COVID-19 is a novel disease, therefore the full range of signs and symptoms, the clinical course of the disease, and the individuals and populations most at risk for disease and complications are not yet fully understood. Monitor the  CDC website  for updates on these topics. Although many large facilities such as prisons and some jails usually employ onsite healthcare staff and have the capacity to evaluate incarcerated/detained persons for potential illness within a dedicated healthcare space, many smaller facilities do not. Some of these facilities have access to on-call healthcare staff or providers who visit the facility every few days. Others have neither onsite healthcare capacity nor onsite medical isolation/quarantine space and must transfer ill patients to other correctional or detention facilities or local hospitals for evaluation and care. The majority of the guidance below is designed to be applied to any correctional or detention facility, either as written or with modifications based on a facilitys individual structure and resources. However, topics related to healthcare evaluation and clinical care of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts may not apply directly to facilities with limited or no onsite healthcare services. It will be especially important for these types of facilities to coordinate closely with their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department when they encounter confirmed or suspected cases among incarcerated/detained persons or staff, in order to ensure effective medical isolation and quarantine, necessary medical evaluation and care, and medical transfer if needed. The guidance makes note of strategies tailored to facilities without onsite healthcare where possible. Note that all staff in any sized facility, regardless of the presence of onsite healthcare services, should observe guidance on  recommended PPE  in order to ensure their own safety when interacting with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. Facilities should make contingency plans for the likely event of  PPE shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Administrators can plan and prepare for COVID-19 by ensuring that all persons in the facility know the  symptoms of COVID-19 and how to respond if they develop symptoms. Other essential actions include developing contingency plans for reduced workforces due to absences, coordinating with public health and correctional partners, and communicating clearly with staff and incarcerated/detained persons about these preparations and how they may temporarily alter daily life.

Other essential actions include developing contingency plans for reduced workforces due to absences, coordinating with public health and correctional partners, and communicating clearly with staff and incarcerated/detained persons about these preparations and how they may temporarily alter daily life. Cases of COVID-19 have been documented in all 50 US states. Correctional and detention facilities can prevent introduction of COVID-19 from the community and reduce transmission if it is already inside by reinforcing good hygiene practices among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors (including increasing access to soap and paper towels), intensifying cleaning/disinfection practices, and implementing social distancing strategies. Because many individuals infected with COVID-19 do not display symptoms, the virus could be present in facilities before cases are identified. Both good hygiene practices and social distancing are critical in preventing further transmission. NOTE: Suspending visitation would be done in the interest of incarcerated/detained persons physical health and the health of the general public. However, visitation is important to maintain mental health. If visitation is suspended, facilities should explore alternative ways for incarcerated/detained persons to communicate with their families, friends, and other visitors in a way that is not financially burdensome for them. See above suggestions for promoting non-contact visits. Cases of COVID-19 have been documented in all 50 US states.

If there has been a suspected COVID-19 case inside the facility (among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, or visitors who have recently been inside), begin implementing Management strategies while test results are pending. Essential Management strategies include placing cases and individuals with symptoms under medical isolation, quarantining their close contacts, and facilitating necessary medical care, while observing relevant infection control and environmental disinfection protocols and wearing recommended PPE. NOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity.  Facilities without onsite healthcare capacity ,  or without sufficient space to implement effective medical isolation, should  coordinate with local public health officials to ensure that COVID-19 cases will be appropriately isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and given care.  If the ideal choice does not exist in a facility, use the next best alternative. Additional information on cleaning and disinfection of communal facilities such can be found on  CDCs website .

Clinicians considering testing of persons with possible COVID-19 should continue to work with their local and state health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories, or use COVID-19 diagnostic testing, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) through clinical laboratories. Increasing testing capacity will allow clinicians to consider COVID-19 testing for a wider group of symptomatic patients. Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever 1  and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). Priorities for testing include: Other considerations that may guide testing are epidemiologic factors such as the occurrence of local community transmission of COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction. Clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness.

They should also notify infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their state or local health department if a patient is classified as a PUI for COVID-19. State health departments that have identified a PUI or a laboratory-confirmed case should complete a  PUI and Case Report form  through the processes identified on CDCs Coronavirus Disease 2019 website. State and local health departments can contact CDCs Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours or on weekends or holidays. For initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal swab). CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for COVID-19. The induction of sputum is not recommended. For patients for whom it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified, regardless of the time of symptom onset. See  Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19and  Biosafety FAQs  for handling and processing specimens from suspected cases and PUIs. 1 Fever may be subjective or confirmed 2 For healthcare personnel, testing may be considered if there has been exposure to a person with suspected COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation. Because of their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable patients in healthcare settings, even mild signs and symptoms (e.g., sore throat) of COVID-19 should be evaluated among potentially exposed healthcare personnel.

This guidance is intended to provide key actions that local and state health departments, homelessness service systems, housing authorities, emergency planners, healthcare facilities, and homeless outreach services can take to protect people experiencing homelessness from the spread of COVID-19. People experiencing unsheltered homelessness (those sleeping outside or in places not meant for human habitation) may be at risk for infection when there is community spread of COVID-19. This interim guidance is intended to support response planning by local and state health departments, homelessness service systems, housing authorities, emergency planners, healthcare facilities, and homeless outreach services. Homeless shelters and other facilities should also refer to the  Interim Guidance for Homeless Shelters . Community and faith-based organizations can refer to the  Interim Guidance for Community and Faith-based Organizations for other information related to their staff and organizations. COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus. There is much to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features of the disease. Everyone can do their part to help plan, prepare, and respond to this emerging public health threat. Lack of housing contributes to poor health outcomes, and linkage to permanent housing should continue to be a priority. In the context of COVID-19, the risks associated with sleeping outdoors in an encampment setting are different than with staying indoors in a congregate setting such as an emergency shelter or other congregate living facility. Outdoor settings may allow people to increase distance between themselves and others. However, sleeping outdoors often does not provide protection from the environment, quick access to hygiene and sanitation facilities, or connection to healthcare. The balance of risks should be considered for each individual experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Reaching and protecting people experiencing unsheltered homelessness during the COVID-19 outbreak will require coordination across several local sectors. To prevent negative outcomes from lack of services, community leaders should continue activities that protect people experiencing homelessness, including supporting continuity of homeless services, healthcare, behavioral health services, food pantries, and linkages to permanent housing. Plans need to be clearly communicated to all stakeholders. Encampments : Communications : Provide straightforward communications to people sleeping outside in the appropriate language. Identify people who are influential in the community who can help communicate with others. Post signs in strategic locations to provide information on hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette. Request up-to-date contact information for each person. Information to share includes: Some people who are experiencing unsheltered homelessness may be at higher risk of moderate to severe disease because of  certain conditions . Pay particular attention to preventing disease among these individuals. Local partners should plan for where individuals and families with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experiencing unsheltered homelessness can safely stay. These should include places where people who are confirmed to be positive and those awaiting test results can be isolated. Additionally, if a person needs to be hospitalized, a plan should be in place for how they will safely recover after discharge. Ideally, these individuals will be housed for the duration necessary, as outlined in the  recommendations for discontinuation of isolation . Isolation housing could be units designated by local authorities or shelters determined to have capacity to sufficiently isolate these individuals. If medical care is not necessary and if no other options are available, advise the individual on how to isolate themselves while efforts are underway to provide additional support. In each scenario, identify how to safely transport patients to and from healthcare and housing facilities. Behavioral health teams should be involved in the planning for these sites to facilitate continued access to support for people with substance abuse or mental health disorders. In some situations, for example due to severe untreated mental illness, an individual may not be able to comply with isolation recommendations. In these cases, community leaders should consult local health authorities to determine alternative options. A local surge in the need for medical care may require jurisdictions to establish isolation sites and alternate care sites (ACS) where patients with COVID-19 can remain for the duration of their isolation period. These are typically established in non-traditional environments, such as converted hotels or mobile field medical units. Isolation sites are intended to be locations for patients who do not require medical care, while ACS are intended be locations for patients who require some degree of medical care. Isolation sites can be used for people with COVID-19 who are currently experiencing homelessness and cannot be discharged to a congregate setting.

This interim guidance is intended to support response planning by homeless service providers, including overnight emergency shelters, day shelters, and meal service providers. COVID-19 is caused by a new virus. There is  much to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features of the disease . Everyone can do their part to help plan, prepare, and respond to this emerging public health threat. CDC has developed recommendations for homeless service providers about how to protect their staff, clients, and guests. The  Before ,  During , and  After  sections of this guidance offer suggested strategies to help homeless service providers plan, prepare, and respond to this emerging public health threat.

CDC has developed recommendations for homeless service providers about how to protect their staff, clients, and guests. The  Before ,  During , and  After  sections of this guidance offer suggested strategies to help homeless service providers plan, prepare, and respond to this emerging public health threat. Although it is not possible to know the course of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, preparing now is the best way to protect people experiencing homelessness, homeless service provider staff, and volunteers from this disease. An outbreak of COVID-19 in your community could cause illness among people experiencing homelessness, contribute to an increase in emergency shelter usage, and/or lead to illness and absenteeism among homeless service provider staff. Having an emergency plan in place can help reduce the impact of the outbreak. During your planning process, homeless service providers should collaborate, share information, and review plans with community leaders and local public health officials to help protect their staff, clients, and guests. Set a time to discuss what homeless service providers should do if cases of COVID-19 are suspected in their facility, if a confirmed case of COVID-19 is identified in a client, or if a confirmed case of COVID-19 in a person experiencing homelessness is discharged from a local hospital. Identify if alternate care sites are available for clients with confirmed COVID-19 or if service providers should plan to isolate cases within their facility. Find out if your local government has a private-public emergency planning group that meets regularly. Building strong alliances before an outbreak may provide your organization with the support and resources needed to respond effectively. Also, in recognition of the  whole community external icon  approach to emergency planning and management, your input as community leaders and stakeholders helps ensure that your local governments emergency operations plan is complete and represented.

Identify a list of key contacts  at your local and state health departments. Identify a list of healthcare facilities  and alternative care sites where clients with respiratory illness can seek housing and receive appropriate care. Include contingency plans  for increased absenteeism caused by employee illness or by illness in employees family members that requires employees to stay home. These plans might include extending hours, cross-training current employees, or hiring temporary employees. Promote the practice of everyday preventive actions.  Use health messages and materials developed by credible public health sources, such as your local and state public health departments or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Read more about  everyday preventive actions. Provide COVID-19 prevention supplies at your organization.  Have supplies on hand for staff, volunteers, and those you serve, such as soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol, tissues, trash baskets, and disposable  facemasks pdf icon . Plan to have extra supplies on hand during a COVID-19 outbreak. Note: Disposable facemasks should be kept on-site and used only when someone is sick at your organization. Those who are sick should be immediately isolated from those who are not sick and given a clean disposable facemask to wear while staying at the shelter. Plan for staff and volunteer absences.  Develop flexible attendance and sick-leave policies. Staff (and volunteers) may need to stay home when they are sick, caring for a sick household member, or caring for their children in the event of school dismissals. Identify critical job functions and positions, and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff members. Note: Use a process similar to the one you use when you cover for staff workers during the holidays. Be prepared to report cases of respiratory illness that might be COVID-19 to your local health department and to transport persons with severe illness to medical facilities.  Discuss reporting procedures ahead of time with a contact person at your local health department. If possible, identify space that can be used to accommodate clients with mild respiratory symptoms and separate them from others.  Most persons with COVID-19 infections will likely have mild symptoms and not require hospital care. Furthermore, it might not be possible to determine if a person has COVID-19 or another respiratory illness. Designate a room and bathroom (if available) for clients with mild illness who remain at the shelter and develop a plan for cleaning the room daily. Identify clients who could be at  high risk  for complications  from COVID-19 (those who are older or have underlying health conditions) to ensure their needs are taken into consideration. Prepare  healthcare clinic staff   to care for patients with COVID-19, if your facility provides healthcare services and ensure facility has supply of personal protective equipment. Plan for higher shelter usage during the outbreak. Consult with community leaders, local public health departments, and faith-based organizations about places to refer clients if your shelter space is full.

{"scrapedAt": "2020-04-02T02:03:00", "title": "Interim Guidance for Collection and Submission of Postmortem Specimens from Deceased Persons Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19", "publishedAt": "2020-03-25T00:00:00", "content": "This document is an update to interim guidance as of March 25, 2020 include: CDC guidance for COVID-19 may be adapted by state and local health departments to respond to rapidly changing local circumstances. Medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists should  immediately  notify their  local external icon  or  state  external icon health department in the event of the identification of a deceased person with known or suspected COVID-19. State and local health departments who have identified a deceased known or suspected COVID-19 case can notify CDCs Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for urgent consultation if an autopsy is being considered or submission of autopsy tissue specimens or postmortem swabs to CDC for COVID-19 testing is desired. The EOC will assist local/state health departments to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately to CDC, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Current knowledge about the disease and transmission is based on preliminary data and on what is known about similar coronaviruses. Most often, spread from a living person happens with close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. This route of transmission is not a concern when handling human remains or performing postmortem procedures. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. CDC will update this interim guidance as additional information becomes available. This document provides specific guidance for the collection and submission of postmortem specimens from deceased known or suspected COVID-19 cases.  This document also provides recommendations for biosafety and infection control practices during specimen collection and handling, including during autopsy procedures. The guidance can be utilized by medical examiners, coroners, pathologists, other workers involved in providing postmortem care, and local and state health departments. Postmortem activities should be conducted with a focus on avoiding aerosol generating procedures and ensuring that if aerosol generation is likely (e.g., when using an oscillating saw) that appropriate engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) are used. These precautions and the use of  Standard Precautions  should ensure that appropriate work practices are used to prevent direct contact with infectious material, percutaneous injury, and hazards related to moving heavy remains and handling embalming chemicals. Medical examiners, coroners, and other healthcare professionals should use their judgment to determine if a decedent had signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 during life and whether postmortem testing should be pursued. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). There are epidemiologic factors that may also help guide decisions about COVID-19 testing, such as documented COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction, known community transmission, contact with a known COVID-19 case, or being a part of a cluster of respiratory illness in a closed setting (e.g., a long-term care facility). Testing for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza) is strongly encouraged. Recommendations about the type of postmortem specimens to  collect vary based on whether the case of COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, as well as whether an autopsy is performed. The following factors should be considered when determining if an autopsy will be performed for a deceased known or suspected COVID-19 case: medicolegal jurisdiction, facility environmental controls, availability of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), and family and cultural wishes. If an autopsy is performed for a suspected COVID-19 case,  collection of the following postmortem specimens is recommended: If an autopsy is NOT performed for a suspected COVID-19 case , collection of the following postmortem specimens is recommended: If an autopsy is performed for a confirmed COVID-19 case,  collection of the following postmortem specimens should be considered: In addition to postmortem specimens, any remaining specimens (e.g., NP swab, sputum, serum, stool) that may have been collected prior to death should be retained. Please refer to  Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)  for more information. Instructions in this section apply if  only  postmortem NP swabs are being collected from a deceased person with known or suspected COVID-19.  If an autopsy is being performed or aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) are being conducted, instructions in the section Autopsy Procedures should be followed. If only a postmortem NP swab is being collected, individuals in the room during specimen collection should be limited to healthcare personnel (HCP) obtaining the specimen. HCP should follow Standard Precautions. Since collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens from deceased persons will not induce coughing or sneezing, a negative pressure room is  not  required if  only  a NP swab is being collected from the decedent. Personnel should adhere to Standard Precautions as described above. Since collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens from deceased persons will not induce coughing or sneezing, NIOSH-certified disposable N-95 respirator or higher is  not  required if  only  a NP swab is being collected from the decedent. The following PPE should be worn at a minimum: Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, and Airborne Precautions with eye protection (goggles or a face shield)  should be followed during autopsy. Many of the following procedures are consistent with existing guidelines for safe work practices in the autopsy setting; see  Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories . Autopsies on known or suspected COVID-19 cases should be conducted in Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (AIIRs). These rooms are at negative pressure to surrounding areas, have a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (ACH) for existing structures and 12 ACH for renovated or new structures, and have air exhausted directly outside or through a HEPA filter. Doors to the room should be kept closed except during entry and egress. If an AIIR is not available, ensure the room is negative pressure with no air recirculation to adjacent spaces. A portable HEPA recirculation unit could be placed in the room to provide further reduction in aerosols. Local airflow control (i.e., laminar flow systems) can be used to direct aerosols away from personnel. If use of an AIIR or HEPA unit is not possible, the procedure should be performed in the most protective environment possible. Air should never be returned to the building interior, but should be exhausted outdoors, away from areas of human traffic or gathering spaces and away from other air intake systems. The following PPE should be worn during autopsy procedures: Surgical scrubs, shoe covers, and surgical cap should be used per routine protocols.  Doff (take off) PPE pdf icon  carefully to avoid contaminating yourself and before leaving the autopsy suite or adjacent anteroom. After removing PPE, discard the PPE in the appropriate laundry or waste receptacle. Reusable PPE (e.g., goggles, face shields, and PAPRs) must be cleaned and disinfected according to the manufacturers recommendations before reuse. Immediately after doffing PPE, wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If hands are not visibly dirty and soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water before using alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching the face with gloved or unwashed hands. Ensure that hand hygiene facilities are readily available at the point of use (e.g., at or adjacent to the PPE doffing area). If the PPE supply is low, see  Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE. Additional safety and health guidance is available for workers handling deceased known or suspected COVID-19 cases at the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), COVID-19 website external icon . Implementing proper biosafety and infection control practices is critical when collecting specimens. Please refer to  Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for additional information. For suspected COVID-19 cases , CDC recommends collecting and testing postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs (NP swabs) and if an autopsy is performed, lower respiratory specimens (lung swabs). If the diagnosis of COVID-19 was established before death, collection of these specimens for COVID-19 testing may not be necessary. Medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists should work with their local or state health department to determine capacity for testing postmortem swab specimens. Use only synthetic fiber swabs with plastic shafts. Do not use calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts, as they may contain substances that inactivate some viruses and inhibit PCR testing. Place swabs immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 ml of viral transport media. NP and lung swab specimens should be kept in separate vials. Refrigerate specimen at 2-8C and ship overnight to CDC on ice pack. Store specimens at 2-8C for up to 72 hours after collection.If a delay in testing or shipping is expected, store specimens at -70C or below. Separate postmortem specimens (e.g., NP or lung swabs) should be collected for routine testing of respiratory pathogens at either clinical or public health labs. Note that clinical laboratories should NOT attempt viral isolation from specimens collected from known or suspected COVID-19 cases. Other postmortem specimen collection and evaluations should be directed by the decedents clinical and exposure history, scene investigation, and gross autopsy findings, and may include routine bacterial cultures, toxicology, and other studies as indicated. The preferred specimens would be a minimum of eight blocks and fixed tissue specimens representing samples from the respiratory sites listed below in addition to specimens from major organs (including liver, spleen, kidney, heart, GI tract) and any other tissues showing significant gross pathology. The recommended respiratory sites include: Viral antigens and nucleic acid may be focal or sparsely distributed in patients with respiratory viral infections and are most frequently detected in respiratory epithelium of large airways. For example, larger airways (particularly primary and segmental bronchi) have the highest yield for detection of respiratory viruses by molecular testing and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Performance of specific immunohistochemical, molecular, or other assays will be determined using clinical and epidemiologic information provided by the submitter and the histopathologic features identified in the submitted tissue specimens. Collection of tissue samples roughly 4-5 mm in thickness (i.e., sample would fit in a tissue cassette) is recommended for optimal fixation. The volume of formalin used to fix tissues should be 10x the volume of tissue. Place tissue in 10% buffered formalin for three days (72 hours) for optimal fixation. After collecting and properly securing and labeling specimens in primary containers with the appropriate media/solution, they must be transferred from the autopsy suite in a safe manner to laboratory staff who can process them for shipping. Medical examiners, coroners, and other healthcare professionals should work with their state and local health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories. In addition, COVID-19 testing, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), is becoming available in clinical laboratories. State and local health departments can contact CDCs Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for assistance with obtaining, storing, and shipping appropriate specimens to CDC for testing, including after hours or on weekends or holidays, if testing of postmortem swab specimens is not available in their public health laboratory. This section applies to submission of postmortem NP swab and lung swabs Postmortem swab specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 cases must be packaged, shipped, and transported according to the current edition of the  International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations external icon . Additional useful and detailed information on packing, shipping, and transporting specimens can be found at  Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) . CDCs Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch (IDPB) can receive fixed autopsy tissue specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 cases. IDPB will perform histopathologic evaluation; testing for COVID-19, as well as other respiratory viral pathogens (e.g., influenza); and bacterial and other infections, as indicated. In general, this is the preferred specimen and is especially important to submit in cases where tissues have been in formalin for a significant time. Prolonged fixation (>2 weeks) may interfere with some immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostic assays. If available, we highly recommend that unprocessed tissues in 10% neutral buffered formalin be submitted in addition to paraffin blocks. The following are general guidelines for cleaning and waste disposal following an autopsy of a decedent with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Current evidence suggests that novel coronavirus may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Routine cleaning and disinfection procedures (e.g., using cleaners and water to pre-clean surfaces prior to applying Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved disinfectant  products with emerging viral pathogens claims external icon thatare expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses in these settings. After an autopsy of a decedent with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the following recommendations apply for the autopsy room (and anteroom if applicable): Follow standard routine procedures when transporting the body after specimens have been collected and the body has been bagged. Disinfect the outside of the bag with a  product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims external icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 applied according to the manufacturers recommendations. Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag. This document is an update to interim guidance as of March 25, 2020 include: CDC guidance for COVID-19 may be adapted by state and local health departments to respond to rapidly changing local circumstances. Medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists should  immediately  notify their  local external icon  or  state  external icon health department in the event of the identification of a deceased person with known or suspected COVID-19. State and local health departments who have identified a deceased known or suspected COVID-19 case can notify CDCs Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for urgent consultation if an autopsy is being considered or submission of autopsy tissue specimens or postmortem swabs to CDC for COVID-19 testing is desired. The EOC will assist local/state health departments to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately to CDC, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Current knowledge about the disease and transmission is based on preliminary data and on what is known about similar coronaviruses. Most often, spread from a living person happens with close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. This route of transmission is not a concern when handling human remains or performing postmortem procedures. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. CDC will update this interim guidance as additional information becomes available. This document provides specific guidance for the collection and submission of postmortem specimens from deceased known or suspected COVID-19 cases.  This document also provides recommendations for biosafety and infection control practices during specimen collection and handling, including during autopsy procedures. The guidance can be utilized by medical examiners, coroners, pathologists, other workers involved in providing postmortem care, and local and state health departments. Postmortem activities should be conducted with a focus on avoiding aerosol generating procedures and ensuring that if aerosol generation is likely (e.g., when using an oscillating saw) that appropriate engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) are used. These precautions and the use of  Standard Precautions  should ensure that appropriate work practices are used to prevent direct contact with infectious material, percutaneous injury, and hazards related to moving heavy remains and handling embalming chemicals. Medical examiners, coroners, and other healthcare professionals should use their judgment to determine if a decedent had signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 during life and whether postmortem testing should be pursued. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing). There are epidemiologic factors that may also help guide decisions about COVID-19 testing, such as documented COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction, known community transmission, contact with a known COVID-19 case, or being a part of a cluster of respiratory illness in a closed setting (e.g., a long-term care facility). Testing for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza) is strongly encouraged. Recommendations about the type of postmortem specimens to  collect vary based on whether the case of COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, as well as whether an autopsy is performed. The following factors should be considered when determining if an autopsy will be performed for a deceased known or suspected COVID-19 case: medicolegal jurisdiction, facility environmental controls, availability of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), and family and cultural wishes. If an autopsy is performed for a suspected COVID-19 case,  collection of the following postmortem specimens is recommended: If an autopsy is NOT performed for a suspected COVID-19 case , collection of the following postmortem specimens is recommended: If an autopsy is performed for a confirmed COVID-19 case,  collection of the following postmortem specimens should be considered: In addition to postmortem specimens, any remaining specimens (e.g., NP swab, sputum, serum, stool) that may have been collected prior to death should be retained. Please refer to  Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)  for more information. Instructions in this section apply if  only  postmortem NP swabs are being collected from a deceased person with known or suspected COVID-19.  If an autopsy is being performed or aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) are being conducted, instructions in the section Autopsy Procedures should be followed. If only a postmortem NP swab is being collected, individuals in the room during specimen collection should be limited to healthcare personnel (HCP) obtaining the specimen. HCP should follow Standard Precautions. Since collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens from deceased persons will not induce coughing or sneezing, a negative pressure room is  not  required if  only  a NP swab is being collected from the decedent. Personnel should adhere to Standard Precautions as described above. Since collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens from deceased persons will not induce coughing or sneezing, NIOSH-certified disposable N-95 respirator or higher is  not  required if  only  a NP swab is being collected from the decedent.

Local and state public health staff will determine if the patient meets the  criteria for testing  for COVID-19. The state and local health department will assist clinicians to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. Clinical specimens should be collected for routine testing of respiratory pathogens at either clinical or public health labs. Note that clinical laboratories should NOT attempt viral isolation from specimens collected from persons suspected to have COVID-19 unless this is performed in a BSL3 laboratory. Testing for otherpathogens by the provider should be done as part of the initial evaluation but should not delay testing for COVID-19. All testing for COVID-19 should be conducted in consultation with a healthcare provider, and only for patients demonstrating symptomatic disease. The guidance below addresses options for self-collection of specimens once a clinical determination has been made to pursue COVID-19 testing. For initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19, CDC recommends collecting and testing an upper respiratory specimen. Nasopharyngeal specimen is the preferred choice for swab-based SARS-CoV-2 testing. When collection of a nasopharyngeal swab is not possible, the following are acceptable alternatives: For NS, a single polyester swab with a plastic shaft should be used to sample both nares. NS or NMT swabs should be placed in a transport tube containing either viral transport medium, Amies transport medium, or sterile saline. If both NP and OP swabs both are collected, they should be combined in a single tube to maximize test sensitivity and limit testing resources. CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The induction of sputum is not recommended. When it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a decision has been made to pursue COVID-19 testing, regardless of the time of symptom onset. Maintain  proper infection control when collecting specimens. See  Biosafety FAQs for handling and processing specimens from suspected case patients. Store specimens at 2-8C and ship overnight to CDC on ice pack. Label each specimen container with the patients ID number (e.g., medical record number), unique specimen ID (e.g., laboratory requisition number), specimen type (e.g., serum) and the date the sample was collected. Complete a  CDC Form 50.34 for each specimen submitted.

Local and state public health staff will determine if the patient meets the  criteria for testing  for COVID-19. The state and local health department will assist clinicians to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. Clinical specimens should be collected for routine testing of respiratory pathogens at either clinical or public health labs. Note that clinical laboratories should NOT attempt viral isolation from specimens collected from persons suspected to have COVID-19 unless this is performed in a BSL3 laboratory. Testing for otherpathogens by the provider should be done as part of the initial evaluation but should not delay testing for COVID-19. All testing for COVID-19 should be conducted in consultation with a healthcare provider, and only for patients demonstrating symptomatic disease. The guidance below addresses options for self-collection of specimens once a clinical determination has been made to pursue COVID-19 testing. For initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19, CDC recommends collecting and testing an upper respiratory specimen. Nasopharyngeal specimen is the preferred choice for swab-based SARS-CoV-2 testing. When collection of a nasopharyngeal swab is not possible, the following are acceptable alternatives: For NS, a single polyester swab with a plastic shaft should be used to sample both nares. NS or NMT swabs should be placed in a transport tube containing either viral transport medium, Amies transport medium, or sterile saline. If both NP and OP swabs both are collected, they should be combined in a single tube to maximize test sensitivity and limit testing resources. CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. The induction of sputum is not recommended. When it is clinically indicated (e.g., those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation), a lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage sample should be collected and tested as a lower respiratory tract specimen. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a decision has been made to pursue COVID-19 testing, regardless of the time of symptom onset. Maintain  proper infection control when collecting specimens. See  Biosafety FAQs for handling and processing specimens from suspected case patients. Store specimens at 2-8C and ship overnight to CDC on ice pack. Label each specimen container with the patients ID number (e.g., medical record number), unique specimen ID (e.g., laboratory requisition number), specimen type (e.g., serum) and the date the sample was collected.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with  MERS-CoV ,  SARS-CoV , and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the  United States . Some international  destinations now have ongoing community spread  with the virus that causes COVID-19, as do some parts of the United States. Community spread means some people have been infected and it is not known how or where they became exposed. Learn more about the  spread of this newly emerged coronavirus .

The complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully known. Reported illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild,  a report external icon  out of China suggests serious illness occurs in 16% of cases. Older people and people of all ages with severe chronic medical conditions  like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example  seem to be at  higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness . A  CDC Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report that looked at severity of disease among COVID-19 cases in the United States by age group found that 80% of deaths were among adults 65 years and older with the highest percentage of severe outcomes occurring in people 85 years and older. Learn more about the  symptoms associated with COVID-19 . A pandemic is a global outbreak of disease. Pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people sustainably. Because there is little to no pre-existing immunity against the new virus, it spreads worldwide. The virus that causes COVID-19 is infecting people and spreading easily from person-to-person. On March 11, the COVID-19 outbreak was  characterized as a pandemic by the WHO external icon . This is the first pandemic known to be caused by a new coronavirus. In the past century, there have been four pandemics caused by the emergence of new influenza viruses. As a result, most research and guidance around pandemics is specific to influenza, but the same premises can be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemics of respiratory disease follow a certain progression outlined in a  Pandemic Intervals Framework . Pandemics begin with an investigation phase, followed by recognition, initiation, and acceleration phases. The peak of illnesses occurs at the end of the acceleration phase, which is followed by a deceleration phase, during which there is a decrease in illnesses. Different countries can be in different phases of the pandemic at any point in time and different parts of the same country can also be in different phases of a pandemic.

Risk depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people; the severity of resulting illness; and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccines or medications that can treat the illness) and the relative success of these. In the absence of vaccine or treatment medications,  nonpharmaceutical interventions become the most important response strategy. These are community interventions that can reduce the impact of disease. The risk from COVID-19 to Americans can be broken down into risk of exposure versus risk of serious illness and death. Risk of exposure: Risk of Severe Illness: Early information out of China, where COVID-19 first started, shows that  some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness. This includes: CDC has developed  guidance to help in the risk assessment and management of people with potential exposures to COVID-19. More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in the United States in the coming days, including more instances of community spread. CDC expects that widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the United States will occur. In the coming months, most of the U.S. population will be exposed to this virus. Widespread transmission of COVID-19 could translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, and workplaces, may experience more absenteeism. Mass gatherings may be sparsely attended or postponed. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and sectors of the transportation industry may also be affected. Healthcare providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19 and no medications approved to treat it.  Nonpharmaceutical interventions will be the most important response strategy to try to delay the spread of the virus and reduce the impact of disease. Global efforts at this time are focused concurrently on lessening the spread and impact of this virus. The federal government is working closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, as well as public health partners, to respond to this public health threat.

{"scrapedAt": "2020-04-02T02:03:00", "title": "Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers", "publishedAt": "2020-03-26T00:00:00", "content": "Who this is for:  Pediatric Healthcare Providers What this is for:  To inform pediatric healthcare providers of information available on children with COVID-19. How to use:  Refer to this information when managing pediatric patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Relatively few cases of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported in children compared with the total number of cases in the general population. As of Feb. 20, 2020, 2.4% of the 75,465 cases (confirmed and suspected) in China had occurred among persons younger than 19 years old. An analysis from one large city in southern China suggests that, among all cases, the proportion of children younger than 15 years old may have increased from 2% to 13% from early to later in the outbreak. Of the cases reported in China to date, most children had exposure to household members with confirmed COVID-19. In one case, a three-month-old child visited a healthcare setting before COVID-19 was confirmed and was thought to be the first case in a family clusterthe source of infection (healthcare or community) was not determined. At least one child who primarily had gastrointestinal symptoms sought care at multiple outpatient healthcare centers before becoming a confirmed case. During previous outbreaks caused by related zoonotic beta coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the majority of confirmed cases occurred among adults. During the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, less than 5% of cases were diagnosed in patients younger than 18. The majority of SARS cases in patients younger than 18 were thought to have occurred through household transmission, though some cases were hospital-acquired. The majority of MERS-CoV cases in children were also thought to be due to household transmission. Children may play a role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. In one report examining 10 infected children in China, SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) was detected in respiratory specimens up to 22 days after symptoms began and in stool up to 30 days after symptoms began. A case report of a 6-month-old infant describes detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood, stool, and multiple nasopharyngeal swab samples, even though the infants only documented manifestation of illness was one recorded temperature of 38.5 C (101.3 F). Viral culture was not performed on specimens in these reports; therefore, it is uncertain whether persistent or asymptomatic RNA detection represented potentially transmissible virus. Currently, it is unknown if differences in reported incidence of confirmed COVID-19 among children versus adults in China is because of difference in exposures (e.g., children are less likely to care for sick contacts), disease severity, testing, or surveillance (e.g., symptoms at presentation differ from case definitions for surveillance or diagnosis). Illness among pediatric cases appear to be mild, with most cases presenting with: The predominant signs and symptoms of COVID-19 reported to date among all patients are similar to other viral respiratory infections. These include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, were reported in a minority of adult patients. In a report of nine hospitalized infants in China with confirmed COVID-19, only half presented with fever. At least one child to date had primarily gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia at initial presentation. There have been multiple reports to date of children with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data from pediatric cases of SARS and MERS also show milder symptoms among children compared with adults, and adolescents with SARS had more severe symptoms compared with younger children. Co-detection of other respiratory pathogens (influenza, respiratory syncytial virus,  Mycoplasma pneumoniae ) have been described in children with COVID-19. Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children may be similar to those for common viral respiratory infections or other childhood illnesses. It is important for pediatric providers to have an appropriate suspicion of COVID-19, but also to continue to consider and test for other diagnoses, such as influenza (see  CDCs Flu Information for Healthcare Professionals  for more information). Complications of COVID-19 appear to be milder among children compared with adults based on limited reports from China. Severe complications (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock) were reported in one case of a 13-month old with confirmed COVID-19. Other reports describe a mild disease course, including in infants. As of February 20, 2020, just one of the 2,114 deaths among 55,924 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China occurred among children younger than 20 years old. No further details were provided about this patient. Chest X-rays of children with COVID-19 show patchy infiltrates consistent with viral pneumonia, and chest CT scans have shown nodular ground glass opacities. During the 2003-2004 SARS outbreak, patients younger than 12 years old had milder and shorter illnesses than adults, and no deaths were reported. Death was rare among children with MERS. One pediatric death from MERS was reported in a child with cystic fibrosis who had respiratory specimens also positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and multidrug-resistant  Pseudomonas . Though symptoms and disease course for COVID-19 may be milder in children than adults, it is unknown if children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of severe disease. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs recommended or licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for COVID-19. Clinical management includes promptly using recommended infection prevention and control measures (e.g., a respirator or facemask, gloves, gown, eye protection) in healthcare settings and supportive management of complications. Lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-alpha have been used for treatment of children with COVID-19 in China but safety and efficacy of these drugs have not been determined. Remdesivir is an investigational antiviral drug that has been reported to have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Some adult patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir through clinical trials or compassionate use, although remdesivir has not been used for treatment of children with COVID-19.

These are typically established in non-traditional environments, such as converted hotels or mobile field medical units. 1  Isolation sites are intended to be locations for patients who do not require medical care, while ACS are intended be locations for patients who require some degree of medical care. This guidance provides critical infection prevention and control (IPC) considerations for isolation sites and ACS, and is intended to supplement existing plans (created by jurisdictions as part of pandemic planning). The following information is for isolation sites and ACS that house adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, but the patient: This could apply to: The expected duration of care for patients in an isolation site or ACS would be based on their clinical needs and the timeline for  discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions . This guidance addresses two tiers of facilities: Isolation Sites (Tier one):  Temporary housing for a cohort of patients with COVID-19 who do not need medical attention but who cannot stay at home (e.g., they have high-risk family members). A separate facility could be considered to quarantine people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but do not have symptoms. Patients in this type of facility would require limited monitoring and could care for themselves (e.g., do not need assistance with medications or activities of daily living (ADLs)). These facilities would have limited medical staff on hand. These patients could be housed in a dedicated hotel or dormitory meant for this purpose (in their own rooms with their own bathroom). Low-acuity Alternate Care Sites (Tier two):  This level of ACS provides medical care to convalescing cases of COVID-19 after hospital discharge and are equipped to provide low-acuity care for other medical conditions in this population (e.g., assistance with managing blood glucose). These facilities could also house residents with COVID-19 who need to be moved from nursing homes that are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks. These patients would often require some level of assistance (e.g., help with ADLs or medications) and a higher level of monitoring than required for patients in isolation sites. These patients may be better suited in a facility that has an open layout (e.g., school gymnasium) to allow limited numbers of healthcare personnel to more easily monitor their status. This guidance does not address a third tier of ACS ( High-acuity Alternate Care Sites ) that would provide hospital-level care for patients who do not have COVID-19 to increase capacity for hospitals to care for COVID-19 patients. These facilities could also be established to provide hospital level care for patients with COVID-19. State and local healthcare leaders should consider their local situation when deciding which of these facility tiers are needed. Additional consideration should be given to facilities that care for both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients. These scenarios would require additional IPC and staffing considerations. For example, if the ACS provided care to both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients, planning would need to address maintaining physical separation between the different patient cohorts and assigning dedicate personnel to work in each area. This guidance identifies some key considerations for IPC in isolation sites and ACS. However, it does not address other important aspects, including patient transportation to and from nearby healthcare facilities. Jurisdictions should consider how close the facility is to nearby healthcare facilities, including acute care hospitals, and may need to have agreements in place with surrounding healthcare facilities regarding patient transfer.

A separate facility could be considered to quarantine people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but do not have symptoms. Patients in this type of facility would require limited monitoring and could care for themselves (e.g., do not need assistance with medications or activities of daily living (ADLs)). These facilities would have limited medical staff on hand. These patients could be housed in a dedicated hotel or dormitory meant for this purpose (in their own rooms with their own bathroom). Low-acuity Alternate Care Sites (Tier two):  This level of ACS provides medical care to convalescing cases of COVID-19 after hospital discharge and are equipped to provide low-acuity care for other medical conditions in this population (e.g., assistance with managing blood glucose). These facilities could also house residents with COVID-19 who need to be moved from nursing homes that are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks. These patients would often require some level of assistance (e.g., help with ADLs or medications) and a higher level of monitoring than required for patients in isolation sites. These patients may be better suited in a facility that has an open layout (e.g., school gymnasium) to allow limited numbers of healthcare personnel to more easily monitor their status. This guidance does not address a third tier of ACS ( High-acuity Alternate Care Sites ) that would provide hospital-level care for patients who do not have COVID-19 to increase capacity for hospitals to care for COVID-19 patients. These facilities could also be established to provide hospital level care for patients with COVID-19. State and local healthcare leaders should consider their local situation when deciding which of these facility tiers are needed. Additional consideration should be given to facilities that care for both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients. These scenarios would require additional IPC and staffing considerations. For example, if the ACS provided care to both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients, planning would need to address maintaining physical separation between the different patient cohorts and assigning dedicate personnel to work in each area. This guidance identifies some key considerations for IPC in isolation sites and ACS. However, it does not address other important aspects, including patient transportation to and from nearby healthcare facilities. Jurisdictions should consider how close the facility is to nearby healthcare facilities, including acute care hospitals, and may need to have agreements in place with surrounding healthcare facilities regarding patient transfer.

Some coronaviruses cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. CDC regulates animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health; USDA regulates animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and FWS regulates importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources. Some coronaviruses that infect animals have become able to infect humans and then spread between people, but this is rare. Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) are examples of diseases caused by coronaviruses that originated in animals and spread to people. This is what is suspected to have happened with the virus that caused the current outbreak of COVID-19. However, we do not know the exact source of this virus. Public health officials and partners are working hard to identify the source of COVID-19. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person to person. The coronavirus most similar to the virus causing COVID-19 is the one that causes SARS. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19 or that they might be a source of infection in the United States. CDC does not have evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. In the United States, there is no evidence to suggest that any animals, including pets, livestock, or wildlife, might be a source of COVID-19 infection at this time. However, because all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, its always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals. For more information, visit CDCs  Healthy Pets, Healthy People website . CDC has not received any reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19. If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed), you should restrict contact with pets and other animals, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. This can help ensure both you and your animals stay healthy. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. Avoid contact with your pet including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with them. For more information visit:  What to Do if You are Sick .

Recent reports of COVID-19 on cruise ships highlight the risk of infection to cruise ship passengers and crew. Like many other viruses, COVID-19 appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships. Facemasks are most useful when worn by sick people who are coughing or sneezing to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses to others. CDC does not recommend that healthy travelers wear facemasks to protect themselves from COVID-19. It is more important to take these steps to reduce your chances of getting sick: Some countries are conducting exit screening for all passengers leaving their country. Before being permitted to board a departing flight, you may have your temperature taken and be asked questions about your travel history and health. At this time, travel restrictions andentry screening apply only to travelers arriving from some countries or regions with widespread ongoing transmission of COVID-19.

Based on what is currently known about the virus, and about similar coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, but disease transmission via infectious aerosols is currently uncertain. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through fomites. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings. It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection. Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air. This guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of households where  persons under investigation (PUI) or those with confirmed COVID-19 reside or may be in self- isolation. It is aimed at limiting the survival of the virus in the environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available.

There is more to learn about how the disease impacts children. No. If your child is healthy, there is no need for them to wear a facemask. Only people who have symptoms of illness or who are providing care to those who are ill should wear masks. Practice Social Distancing:  The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to limit contact as much as possible. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.To help children maintain social connections while social distancing, help your children have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends. Clean Hands Often:  Make sure children practice  everyday preventive behaviors , such as washing their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. This is especially important if you have been in a public place. Revise Spring Break & Travel Plans:  Revise spring break and travel plans if they included non-essential travel.

Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine. Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths. Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem. People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. Counter stigma by learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop stigma.

People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine. Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths. Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.

People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. Counter stigma by learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop stigma.

Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the  Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus . This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. Its important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so. The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in  some affected geographic areas . Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Learn what is known about the  spread of newly emerged coronaviruses . The  number of cases of COVID-19  being reported in the United States is rising due to  increased laboratory testing  and reporting across the country. The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread. More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts. The virus that causes COVID-19 is  spreading from person-to-person . Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient. Current  CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements: Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others. Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures. Learn what is known about the  spread of COVID-19 . It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods of time at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc. Regardless of temperature please follow  CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection . At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.

For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.

Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods of time at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we dont have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc. Regardless of temperature please follow  CDCs guidance for cleaning and disinfection .

Visit the  COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19. There is information for  people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online. Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions  may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes: If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others; when you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel.If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on  People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.  CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. You should only wear a mask if a healthcare professional recommends it. A facemask should be used by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms. This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected. The use of facemasks also is crucial for  health workers and other  people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads.  The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.This type of spread is not a concern after death. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and facemask). Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).  Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims pdf icon external icon  are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. After removal of PPE, perform  hand hygiene  by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled. A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19. Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19. If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow  Standard Precautions , including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected. For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a  product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims pdf icon external icon expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturers instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag. Embalming can be conducted. During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g. disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and facemask). Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturers label. Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin. Additional information on how to safely conduct aerosol-generating procedures is in the  CDCs Postmortem Guidance . Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturers instructions.

Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled. Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases. When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased persons next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State. Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies. If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of States Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer. In addition, the  US embassy external icon  closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance. CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceaseds employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office. CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a  quarantinable communicable disease . At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions: Please see  CDCs guidance  for additional information.

Ensure only trained personnel wearing recommended  personal protective equipment (PPE)  have contact with or transport individuals who have or may have COVID-19.  People who are incarcerated and have COVID-19 should be placed under medical isolation in a separate room, ideally with solid walls and a solid door that closes fully. If not available, refer to the  full guidance document for other options for medical isolation. If multiple people become ill with COVID-19:  To prevent further spread:  Provide clear information to staff and people who are incarcerated about the presence of COVID-19 cases within the facility. Close contacts of the sick person (who have been within 6 feet of the sick person or had direct contact with infectious droplets, such as from a cough or squeeze) should be placed under quarantine for at least 14 days. Follow CDC  guidance on quarantining close contacts of people with COVID-19.  If separate spaces for individual quarantined people are not available, refer to the full guidance document for other  options . Monitor symptoms twice per day and move anyone developing symptoms to medical isolation right away (after ensuring they are wearing a face mask). Quarantined people at high risk for complications of COVID-19 (older adults, people with severe underlying chronic medical conditions) should not be housed with other quarantined people if at all possible. If you think someone on your staff is sick with COVID-19 (see  COVID-19 symptoms ), activate your emergency plan and notify public health officials. Give them a clean,  disposable facemask pdf icon  and send them home right away. Close contacts of the sick person (who have been within 6 feet of the sick person or have had direct contact with infectious droplets, such as from a cough or squeeze) should self-quarantine at for 14 days home and follow  CDC recommended steps for people who are sick with COVID-19 symptoms . Follow guidance for  cleaning and disinfecting rooms and areas where a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 have visited, including transport vehicles.  Ensure staff or people who are incarcerated wear appropriate PPE when cleaning the facility and handling food service items of people with possible or confirmed COVID-19. Laundry of a person with COVID-19 may be washed with the laundry of other individuals. Individuals handling laundry should wear recommended  PPE , should not shake the laundry, and should clean their hands often to prevent spread of COVID . If there is a case of COVID-19 in your facility, suspend contact visitation programs. Instead, use virtual visitation when possible. Facilities should ensure that incarcerated individuals receive medical evaluation and treatment at the first sign of COVID-19 symptoms.

When evaluating and treating persons with symptoms of COVID-19 who do not speak English, provide a translator when possible. Spanish and Simplified Chinese  materials are available for those who need them. Close contacts of a sick person (who have been within about 6 feet of the sick person or have had direct contact with infectious droplets, such as from a cough or squeeze) should be placed under quarantine for 14 days to determine if they develop symptoms. CDC has developed  guidance on quarantining close contacts of people with COVID-19. Be sure to monitor symptoms twice a day and move anyone developing symptoms to medical isolation right away, after ensuring that they are wearing a face mask. Individuals under quarantine should stay within the quarantine space, including when eating their meals, using the bathroom, and receiving medical evaluation. Laundry of people in quarantine can be washed with the laundry of others. Individuals handling laundry should wear recommended  PPE , should not shake the laundry, and should clean their hands often.  Ideally, people under quarantine due to contact with a COVID-19 case should be housed individually. If separate spaces in a facility are not available, refer to CDCs full guidance document for correctional and detention centers for other  options .  People at high risk for complications of COVID-19 (older adults, people with severe underlying chronic medical conditions) should not be housed with other quarantined people if at all possible. Facilities without enough space or without onsite healthcare capacity should coordinate with local public health officials.  Individuals in quarantine can be released from quarantine back to their previous housing arrangement in the facility if they have not developed symptoms during the 14-day time period. The best way to prevent illness is to take steps to avoid being exposed to this virus. Start by ensuring you and others around you use  everyday preventive actions  (such as washing hands often, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, and covering your cough). Read  How to Protect Yourself to learn more.  If there is spread of COVID-19 in the community close to the facility, you will be asked daily about symptoms over the last 24 hours and any contact you had with someone infected with COVID-19 in the last 14 days. Your temperature will also be checked daily. Staff and people incarcerated in correctional and detention facilities are at greater risk for some illnesses, such as COVID-19, because of the close living arrangements inside the facility. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. This is why washing your hands regularly and avoid close contact with other people when possible prevents illness. If you think you have been exposed to  COVID-19  and develop a fever or symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or difficulty breathing, stay home. If you are at work, alert your supervisor right away and go home. Read  What To Do if You Are Sick to learn more. Anyone who has close contact with a person with COVID-19 will need to stay away from other people for at least 14 days to see whether symptoms develop.

Your temperature will also be checked daily. Staff and people incarcerated in correctional and detention facilities are at greater risk for some illnesses, such as COVID-19, because of the close living arrangements inside the facility. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. This is why washing your hands regularly and avoid close contact with other people when possible prevents illness.

The best way to prevent illness is to take steps to avoid being exposed to this virus. Start by ensuring you and others around you use  everyday preventive actions  (such as washing hands often, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, and covering your cough). Read  How to Protect Yourself to learn more.  If there is spread of COVID-19 in the community close to the facility, you will be asked daily about symptoms over the last 24 hours and any contact you had with someone infected with COVID-19 in the last 14 days. Your temperature will also be checked daily. Staff and people incarcerated in correctional and detention facilities are at greater risk for some illnesses, such as COVID-19, because of the close living arrangements inside the facility. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. This is why washing your hands regularly and avoid close contact with other people when possible prevents illness. If you think you have been exposed to  COVID-19  and develop a fever or symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or difficulty breathing, stay home. If you are at work, alert your supervisor right away and go home. Read  What To Do if You Are Sick to learn more. Anyone who has close contact with a person with COVID-19 will need to stay away from other people for at least 14 days to see whether symptoms develop. If you are a close contact of a person with COVID-19, you should self-quarantine at home by staying in a separate room away from others.

{"scrapedAt": "2020-04-02T02:03:00", "title": "Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)", "publishedAt": "2020-03-30T00:00:00", "content": "Revisions were made on March 30, 2020, to reflect the following: This interim guidance is for clinicians caring for patients with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CDC will update this interim guidance as more information becomes available. The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to extend to 14 days, with a median time of 4-5 days from exposure to symptoms onset. 1-3  One study reported that 97.5% of persons with COVID-19 who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 3 The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 present at illness onset vary, but over the course of the disease, most persons with COVID-19 will experience the following 1,4-9 : Atypical presentations have been described and older adults and persons with medical comorbidities may have delayed presentation of fever and respiratory symptoms. 10,11  In one study of 1,099 hospitalized patients, fever was present in only 44% at hospital admission but later developed in 89% during hospitalization. 1  Headache, confusion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, hemoptysis, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported but are less common (<10%). 1,4-6  Some persons with COVID-19 have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. 9  Anosmia or ageusia preceeding the onset of respiratory symptoms has been anecdotally reported, but more information is needed to understand its role in identifying COVID-19. Several studies have reported that the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to adults and are usually milder compared to adults. 12-16  For more information on the clinical presentation and course among children, see  Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers . Several studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and in patients not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic). 13,15,17-25  Since asymptomatic persons are not routinely tested, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and detection of pre-symptomatic infection is not well understood. One study found that as many as 13% of RT-PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were asymptomatic. 13  Another study of skilled nursing facility residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 from a healthcare worker demonstrated that half were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at the time of contact tracing evaluation and testing. 25  Patients may have abnormalities on chest imaging before the onset of symptoms. 19,20  Some data suggest that pre-symptomatic infection tended to be detected in younger individuals and was less likely to be associated with viral pneumonia. 19,20  Although transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic persons has been reported 17,21,22 , risk of transmission is thought to be greatest when patients are symptomatic. Viral RNA shedding, measured indirectly by RT-PCR cycle threshold values, is greatest at the time of symptom onset and declines over the course of several days to weeks. 26,27  The exact degree of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shedding that confers risk of transmission is not yet clear. The largest cohort of >44,000 persons with COVID-19 from China showed that illness severity can range from mild to critical 28 : In this study, all deaths occurred among patients with critical illness and the overall case fatality rate was 2.3%. 28  The case fatality rate among patients with critical disease was 49%. 28  Among children in China, illness severity was lower with 94% having asymptomatic, mild or moderate disease, 5% having severe disease, and <1% having critical disease. 13  Only one (<0.1%) death was reported in a person <18 years old. 13  Among U.S. COVID-19 cases with known disposition, the proportion of persons who were hospitalized was 19%. 29  The proportion of persons with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was 6%. 29 Among patients who developed severe disease, the medium time to dyspnea ranged from 5 to 8 days, the median time to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ranged from 8 to 12 days, and the median time to ICU admission ranged from 10 to 12 days. 5,6,10,11  Clinicians should be aware of the potential for some patients to rapidly deteriorate one week after illness onset. Among all hospitalized patients, a range of 26% to 32% of patients were admitted to the ICU. 6,8,11  Among all patients, a range of 3% to 17% developed ARDS compared to a range of 20% to 42% for hospitalized patients and 67% to 85% for patients admitted to the ICU. 1,4-6,8,11  Mortality among patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 39% to 72% depending on the study. 5,8,10,11  The median length of hospitalization among survivors was 10 to 13 days. 1,6,8 Age is a strong risk factor for severe illness, complications, and death. 1,6,8,10,11,28-31  Among more than 44,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, the case fatality rate was highest among older persons: 80 years: 14.8%, 7079 years: 8.0%, 6069 years: 3.6%, 5059 years: 1.3%, 4049 years: 0.4%, <40 years: 0.2%. 28,32  Early U.S. epidemiologic data suggests that the case fatality was highest in persons aged 85 years (range 10%27%), followed by 3%11% for ages 6584 years, 1%3% for ages 5564 years, and <1% for ages 054 years. 29  Patients with no reported underlying medical conditions had an overall case fatality of 0.9%, but case fatality was higher for patients with comorbidities: 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, and approximately 6% each for chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer. 32  Heart disease, hypertension, prior stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and chronic kidney disease have all been associated with increased illness severity and adverse outcomes. 1,6,10,11,28,32  Accounting for differences in age and prevalence of underlying condition, mortality associated with COVID-19 in the United States was similar to China. 29,30,33  It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. 34  ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter into the host cell. There are no data to suggest a link between ACE inhibitors or ARBs with worse COVID-19 outcomes. The American Heart Association (AHA), the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) released a statement recommending continuation of these drugs for patients already receiving them for heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease. 35 It has also been hypothesized that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may worsen COVID-19. There are no data suggesting an association between COVID-19 clinical outcomes and NSAID use. More information can be found at  Healthcare Professionals: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers . There are no data concerning the possibility of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 after recovery from COVID-19. Viral RNA shedding declines with resolution of symptoms, and may continue for days to weeks. 11,26,27  However, the detection of RNA during convalescence does not necessarily indicate the presence of viable infectious virus. Clinical recovery has been correlated with the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies which signal the development of immunity. 36,37 Diagnosis of COVID-19 requires detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is better in nasopharynx samples compared to throat samples. 27,38  Lower respiratory samples may have better yield than upper respiratory samples. 27,38 . SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in stool and blood. 12,26,37,39  Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood may be a marker of severe illness. 40  Viral RNA shedding may persist over longer periods among older persons and those who had severe illness requiring hospitalization. (median range of viral shedding among hospitalized patients 1220 days). 11,26,27,36,41 Infection with both SARS-CoV-2 and with other respiratory viruses has been reported, and detection of another respiratory pathogen does not rule out COVID-19. 42 For more information about testing and specimen collection, handling and storage, visit  Evaluating and Testing Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)  and  Frequently Asked Questions on COVID-19 Testing at Laboratories . Lymphopenia is the most common lab finding in COVID-19 and is found in as many as 83% of hospitalized patients. 1,5  Lymphopenia, neutrophilia, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, high CRP, and high ferritin levels may be associated with greater illness severity. 1,5,6,8,11,43  Elevated D-dimer and lymphopenia have been associated with mortality. 8,11  Procalcitonin is typically normal on admission, but may increase among those admitted to the ICU. 4-6  Patients with critical illness had high plasma levels of inflammatory makers, suggesting potential immune dysregulation. 5,44 Chest radiographs of patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral air-space consolidation, though patients may have unremarkable chest radiographs early in the disease. 1,5,45  Chest CT images from patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral, peripheral ground glass opacities. 4,8,28,45-54  Because this chest CT imaging pattern is non-specific and overlaps with other infections, the diagnostic value of chest CT imaging for COVID-19 may be low and dependent upon interpretations from individual radiologists. 46,55  One study found that 56% of patients who presented within 2 days of diagnosis had a normal CT 47 . Conversely, other studies have also identified chest CT abnormalities in patients prior to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. 45,56  Given the variability in chest imaging findings, chest radiograph or CT alone is not recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The American College of Radiology also does not recommend CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosis of COVID-19. (See  American College of Radiology Recommendations external icon ). Patients with a mild clinical presentation (absence of viral pneumonia and hypoxia) may not initially require hospitalization, and many patients will be able to manage their illness at home. The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend on the clinical presentation, requirement for supportive care, potential risk factors for severe disease, and the ability of the patients to self-isolate at home. Patients with risk factors for severe illness (see Risk Factors for Severe Illness above) should be monitored closely given the possible risk of progression to severe illness in the second week after symptom onset. 5,6,10,11 For information regarding infection prevention and control recommendations, please see  Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings . Some patients with COVID-19 will have severe disease requiring hospitalization for management. Complications of severe COVID-19 include pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis and septic shock, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, and complications from prolonged hospitalization including secondary bacterial infections. 1,4-6,10,11,28  No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently FDA approved. Corticosteroids have been widely used in hospitalized patients with severe illness in China 6,8,10,11 ; however, the benefit of corticosteroid use cannot be determined based upon uncontrolled observational data. By contrast, patients with MERS-CoV or influenza who were given corticosteroids were more likely to have prolonged viral replication, receive mechanical ventilation, and have higher mortality. 57-61  Therefore, corticosteroids should be avoided unless indicated for other reasons, such as management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock. More information can be found at  Healthcare Professionals: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers . Inpatient management of COVID-19 revolves around the supportive management of the most common complications of severe COVID-19: pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, shock, multiorgan failure, and the complications associated with prolonged hospitalization including secondary nosocomial infection, thromboembolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy. The World Health Organization and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign have both released comprehensive guidelines for the inpatient and ICU management of patients with COVID-19, including those who are critically ill.

For more information on the management of children, see  Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers  and the  Surviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines for the Management of Septic Shock and Sepsis-Associated Organ Dysfunction in Children external icon . No FDA-approved drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials for patients with COVID-19. Use of investigational therapies for treatment of COVID-19 should ideally be done in the context of enrollment in randomized controlled trials. Several clinical trials are underway testing multiple drugs with in-vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and/or immunomodulatory effects that may have clinical benefit. For the latest information, see  Information for Clinicians on Therapeutic Options for COVID-19 Patients . For the information on registered trials in the U.S., see  ClinicalTrials.gov external icon . Patients who have clinically recovered and are able to discharge from the hospital but who have not been cleared from their Transmission-Based Precautions may continue isolation at their place of residence until cleared. For recommendations on discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or home isolation for patients who have recovered from COVID-19 illness, please see:  Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 ,  Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19 , and  Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Immunocompromised Persons with COVID-19 . Revisions were made on March 30, 2020, to reflect the following: This interim guidance is for clinicians caring for patients with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Among all hospitalized patients, a range of 26% to 32% of patients were admitted to the ICU. 6,8,11  Among all patients, a range of 3% to 17% developed ARDS compared to a range of 20% to 42% for hospitalized patients and 67% to 85% for patients admitted to the ICU. 1,4-6,8,11  Mortality among patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 39% to 72% depending on the study. 5,8,10,11  The median length of hospitalization among survivors was 10 to 13 days. 1,6,8 Age is a strong risk factor for severe illness, complications, and death. 1,6,8,10,11,28-31  Among more than 44,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, the case fatality rate was highest among older persons: 80 years: 14.8%, 7079 years: 8.0%, 6069 years: 3.6%, 5059 years: 1.3%, 4049 years: 0.4%, <40 years: 0.2%. 28,32  Early U.S. epidemiologic data suggests that the case fatality was highest in persons aged 85 years (range 10%27%), followed by 3%11% for ages 6584 years, 1%3% for ages 5564 years, and <1% for ages 054 years. 29  Patients with no reported underlying medical conditions had an overall case fatality of 0.9%, but case fatality was higher for patients with comorbidities: 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, and approximately 6% each for chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer. 32  Heart disease, hypertension, prior stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and chronic kidney disease have all been associated with increased illness severity and adverse outcomes. 1,6,10,11,28,32  Accounting for differences in age and prevalence of underlying condition, mortality associated with COVID-19 in the United States was similar to China. 29,30,33  It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. 34  ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter into the host cell. There are no data to suggest a link between ACE inhibitors or ARBs with worse COVID-19 outcomes.

More information can be found at  Healthcare Professionals: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers . Inpatient management of COVID-19 revolves around the supportive management of the most common complications of severe COVID-19: pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, shock, multiorgan failure, and the complications associated with prolonged hospitalization including secondary nosocomial infection, thromboembolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy. The World Health Organization and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign have both released comprehensive guidelines for the inpatient and ICU management of patients with COVID-19, including those who are critically ill.

No FDA-approved drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials for patients with COVID-19. Use of investigational therapies for treatment of COVID-19 should ideally be done in the context of enrollment in randomized controlled trials. Several clinical trials are underway testing multiple drugs with in-vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and/or immunomodulatory effects that may have clinical benefit. For the latest information, see  Information for Clinicians on Therapeutic Options for COVID-19 Patients . For the information on registered trials in the U.S., see  ClinicalTrials.gov external icon . Patients who have clinically recovered and are able to discharge from the hospital but who have not been cleared from their Transmission-Based Precautions may continue isolation at their place of residence until cleared. For recommendations on discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or home isolation for patients who have recovered from COVID-19 illness, please see:  Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 ,  Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19 , and  Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Immunocompromised Persons with COVID-19 .

Frequently Asked Questions: Drugs and Investigational Therapies Updated March 30, 2020 See also the general  COVID-19 FAQ . Frequently Asked Questions: Drugs and Investigational Therapies Frequently Asked Questions: Drugs and Investigational Therapies Frequently Asked Questions: Drugs and Investigational Therapies Q: Who is at risk for infection with the virus that causes COVID-19?  A: Currently, those at greatest risk of infection are persons who have had prolonged, unprotected close contact with a patient with symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 and those who live in or have recently been to areas with sustained transmission. For more information, see  Risk Assessment . Q: Who is at risk for severe disease from COVID-19? A.The available data are currently insufficient to clearly identify risk factors for severe clinical outcomes. Based on limited data that are available for COVID-19 patients, and data from related coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV, people who may be at risk for more severe outcomes include older adults and persons who have certain  underlying chronic medical conditions . Those underlying chronic conditions include chronic lung disease, moderate to severe asthma, cardiac disease with complications, diabetes, or immunocompromising conditions. See also  Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)  and  Information for Healthcare Professionals: COVID-19 and Underlying Conditions . Q: If my patient has one of the  underlying medical conditions listed, what is my patients risk and what should I tell my patient? Q: Are pregnant healthcare personnel at increased risk for adverse outcomes if they care for patients with COVID-19? A: Pregnant healthcare personnel (HCP) should follow  risk assessment  and  infection control guidelines for HCP exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all HCP in healthcare settings. Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is very limited; facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures) if feasible based on staffing availability. Q: When is someone infectious? A: The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infections with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. There are reports of asymptomatic infections (detection of virus with no development of symptoms) and pre-symptomatic infections (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) with SARS-CoV-2, but their role in transmission is not yet known. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 214 days. Q: Which body fluids can spread infection?  A: SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of some patients, including a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer. Duration of several week or longer has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2. Q: Can people who recover from COVID-19 be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2?  A: The immune response, including duration of immunity, to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet understood. Patients with MERS-CoV are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover, but it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19. Q: How do you test a patient for infection with SARS-CoV-2? Q: Do existing commercially available multiple respiratory virus panels, such as those manufactured by Biofire or Genmark, detect SARS-CoV-2?  A: Not currently. These multi-pathogen molecular assays can detect a number of human respiratory viruses, including other human coronaviruses that can cause acute respiratory illness, but they do not currently detect SARS-CoV-2. In the future, it is expected that these assays will have the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens. Q: If a patient tests positive for another respiratory virus, should that exclude SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of illness? A: Patients can be infected with more than one virus at the same time. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses in people with COVID-19 have been reported. Therefore, identifying infection with one respiratory virus does not exclude SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Q: Should chest CT be used for diagnosis of COVID-19? A: Clinicians considering use of chest CT scans for diagnosis or management of COVID-19 patients should consider whether such imaging will change clinical management. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19, or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19, and that CT should be used sparingly and reserved for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications for CT. Appropriate infection control procedures should be followed before scanning subsequent patients. For more information see,  ACR Recommendations for the use of Chest Radiography and Computed Tomography (CT) for Suspected COVID-19 Infection external icon . Q: Whom should healthcare providers notify if they suspect a patient has COVID-19? A:Healthcare Providers should immediately notify infection control personnel at their facility if they suspect COVID-19 in a patient. Providers should then consult with local or state health departments to determine whether patients meet criteria for a Persons Under Investigation (PUI), see  Evaluating and Testing Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Q: Should post-exposure prophylaxis be used for people who may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19?  A: There is currently no FDA-approved post-exposure prophylaxis for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19. For information about registered clinical trials of investigational therapeutics for pre or post exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, visit  ClinicalTrials.gov external icon . For more information on movement restrictions, monitoring for symptoms, and evaluation after possible exposure to COVID-19, see  Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings  and  Interim U.S Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Q: How are COVID-19 patients treated?  A: Not all patients with COVID-19 will require medical supportive care. Clinical management for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is focused on supportive care for complications, including supplemental oxygen and advanced organ support for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial etiologies may be warranted. Corticosteroids are  not  routinely recommended for treatment of viral pneumonia or ARDS, due to the potential for prolonging viral replication, as has been observed with MERS coronavirus and influenza. Corticosteroids should be avoided unless they are indicated for another reason (e.g., COPD exacerbation or refractory septic shock following the  Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines external icon ). For information on investigational therapies, see  Therapeutic Options for Patients with COVID-19 . Q: Do patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be admitted to the hospital? A: Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants in-patient clinical management for supportive medical care should be admitted to the hospital under appropriate isolation precautions. Some patients with initial mild clinical presentation may worsen in the second week of illness. The decision to monitor these patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patients ability to engage in self-monitoring, the feasibility of safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patients home environment. For more information, see  Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Healthcare Setting  and  Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Q: When can patients with confirmed COVID-19 be discharged from the hospital?  A: Patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospital  Transmission-Based Precautions . Decisions to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health authorities based upon multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for COVID-19 in respiratory specimens. See  Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 . For non-hospitalized persons, see  Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for COVID-19 , and  Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Immunocompromised Persons . Q: Are empiric antibiotics recommended for patients suspected of having COVID-19? A: Several patients with COVID-19 have been reported to present with concurrent community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Decisions to administer antibiotics to COVID-19 patients should be based on the likelihood of bacterial infection (community-acquired or hospital-acquired), illness severity, and antimicrobial stewardship issues. For more information, see  Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia: An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America external icon . Q: What antiviral drugs are available to treat COVID-19? A: There are currently no antiviral drugs approved by FDA to treat COVID-19. See  Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Q: Should angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) be stopped in patients with COVID-19? A: CDC is currently not aware of scientific evidence establishing a link between ACE-I or ARBs and risk of contracting or severity of COVID-19. The American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the American College of Cardiology  recommend external icon  continuation of ACE-I or ARB medications for all patients already prescribed those medications for indications such as heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease. Cardiovascular disease patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 should be fully evaluated by a healthcare professional before adding or removing any treatments, and any changes to their treatment should be based on the latest scientific evidence. Patients who rely on ACE-I or ARBs to treat chronic conditions and have additional questions should speak to their healthcare provider for individualized management. Q: Do nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) worsen the course of disease for people with COVID-19? A: CDC is currently not aware of scientific evidence establishing a link between NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and worsening of COVID19.  FDA external icon , the  European Medicines Agency external icon , the  World Health Organization , and CDC are continuing to monitor the situation and will review new information on the effects of NSAIDs and COVID-19 disease as it becomes available. For those who wish to use treatment options other than NSAIDs, there are other over-the-counter and prescription medications approved for pain relief and fever reduction. Patients who rely on NSAIDs to treat chronic conditions and have additional questions should speak to their healthcare provider for individualized management. Patients should use NSAIDs, and all medications, according to the product labels and advice of their healthcare professional. Q: What do waste management companies need to know about wastewater and sewage coming from a healthcare facility or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or person under investigation (PUI)? A: Waste generated in the care of PUIs or patients with confirmed COVID-19 does not present additional considerations for wastewater disinfection in the United States. Coronaviruses are susceptible to the same disinfection conditions in community and healthcare settings as other viruses, so current disinfection conditions in wastewater treatment facilities are expected to be sufficient. This includes conditions for practices such as oxidation with hypochlorite (i.e., chlorine bleach) and peracetic acid, as well as inactivation using UV irradiation. Q: Do wastewater and sewage workers need any additional protection when handling untreated waste from healthcare or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or PUI? A: Wastewater workers should use standard practices including basic hygiene precautions and wear the recommended PPE as prescribed for their current work tasks when handling untreated waste. There is no evidence to suggest that employees of wastewater plants need any additional protections in relation to COVID-19. Q: Should medical waste or general waste from healthcare facilities treating PUIs and patients with confirmed COVID-19 be handled any differently or need any additional disinfection? A: Medical waste (trash) coming from healthcare facilities treating COVID-2019 patients is no different than waste coming from facilities without COVID-19 patients. CDCs guidance states that management of laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should be performed in accordance with routine procedures. There is no evidence to suggest that facility waste needs any additional disinfection. More guidance about environmental infection control is available in section 7 of CDCs Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings. Q: Who is at risk for infection with the virus that causes COVID-19?  A: Currently, those at greatest risk of infection are persons who have had prolonged, unprotected close contact with a patient with symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 and those who live in or have recently been to areas with sustained transmission. For more information, see  Risk Assessment . Q: Who is at risk for severe disease from COVID-19? A.The available data are currently insufficient to clearly identify risk factors for severe clinical outcomes. Based on limited data that are available for COVID-19 patients, and data from related coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV, people who may be at risk for more severe outcomes include older adults and persons who have certain  underlying chronic medical conditions . Those underlying chronic conditions include chronic lung disease, moderate to severe asthma, cardiac disease with complications, diabetes, or immunocompromising conditions. See also  Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)  and  Information for Healthcare Professionals: COVID-19 and Underlying Conditions . Q: If my patient has one of the  underlying medical conditions listed, what is my patients risk and what should I tell my patient? Q: Are pregnant healthcare personnel at increased risk for adverse outcomes if they care for patients with COVID-19? A: Pregnant healthcare personnel (HCP) should follow  risk assessment  and  infection control guidelines for HCP exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all HCP in healthcare settings. Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is very limited; facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures) if feasible based on staffing availability. Q: When is someone infectious? A: The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infections with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. There are reports of asymptomatic infections (detection of virus with no development of symptoms) and pre-symptomatic infections (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) with SARS-CoV-2, but their role in transmission is not yet known. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 214 days. Q: Which body fluids can spread infection?  A: SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of some patients, including a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer. Duration of several week or longer has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2. Q: Can people who recover from COVID-19 be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2?  A: The immune response, including duration of immunity, to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet understood. Patients with MERS-CoV are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover, but it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19. Q: How do you test a patient for infection with SARS-CoV-2? Q: Do existing commercially available multiple respiratory virus panels, such as those manufactured by Biofire or Genmark, detect SARS-CoV-2?  A: Not currently. These multi-pathogen molecular assays can detect a number of human respiratory viruses, including other human coronaviruses that can cause acute respiratory illness, but they do not currently detect SARS-CoV-2. In the future, it is expected that these assays will have the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens. Q: If a patient tests positive for another respiratory virus, should that exclude SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of illness? A: Patients can be infected with more than one virus at the same time. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses in people with COVID-19 have been reported. Therefore, identifying infection with one respiratory virus does not exclude SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Q: Should chest CT be used for diagnosis of COVID-19? A: Clinicians considering use of chest CT scans for diagnosis or management of COVID-19 patients should consider whether such imaging will change clinical management. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19, or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19, and that CT should be used sparingly and reserved for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications for CT. Appropriate infection control procedures should be followed before scanning subsequent patients. For more information see,  ACR Recommendations for the use of Chest Radiography and Computed Tomography (CT) for Suspected COVID-19 Infection external icon . Q: Whom should healthcare providers notify if they suspect a patient has COVID-19? A:Healthcare Providers should immediately notify infection control personnel at their facility if they suspect COVID-19 in a patient. Providers should then consult with local or state health departments to determine whether patients meet criteria for a Persons Under Investigation (PUI), see  Evaluating and Testing Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Q: Should post-exposure prophylaxis be used for people who may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19?  A: There is currently no FDA-approved post-exposure prophylaxis for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19. For information about registered clinical trials of investigational therapeutics for pre or post exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, visit  ClinicalTrials.gov external icon . For more information on movement restrictions, monitoring for symptoms, and evaluation after possible exposure to COVID-19, see  Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings  and  Interim U.S Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Q: How are COVID-19 patients treated?  A: Not all patients with COVID-19 will require medical supportive care. Clinical management for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is focused on supportive care for complications, including supplemental oxygen and advanced organ support for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial etiologies may be warranted. Corticosteroids are  not  routinely recommended for treatment of viral pneumonia or ARDS, due to the potential for prolonging viral replication, as has been observed with MERS coronavirus and influenza. Corticosteroids should be avoided unless they are indicated for another reason (e.g., COPD exacerbation or refractory septic shock following the  Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines external icon ). For information on investigational therapies, see  Therapeutic Options for Patients with COVID-19 . Q: Do patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be admitted to the hospital? A: Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants in-patient clinical management for supportive medical care should be admitted to the hospital under appropriate isolation precautions. Some patients with initial mild clinical presentation may worsen in the second week of illness. The decision to monitor these patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patients ability to engage in self-monitoring, the feasibility of safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patients home environment. For more information, see  Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Healthcare Setting  and  Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Q: When can patients with confirmed COVID-19 be discharged from the hospital?  A: Patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospital  Transmission-Based Precautions . Decisions to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health authorities based upon multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for COVID-19 in respiratory specimens. See  Interim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 . For non-hospitalized persons, see  Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for COVID-19 , and  Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Immunocompromised Persons . Q: Are empiric antibiotics recommended for patients suspected of having COVID-19? A: Several patients with COVID-19 have been reported to present with concurrent community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Decisions to administer antibiotics to COVID-19 patients should be based on the likelihood of bacterial infection (community-acquired or hospital-acquired), illness severity, and antimicrobial stewardship issues. For more information, see  Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia: An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America external icon . Q: What antiviral drugs are available to treat COVID-19? A: There are currently no antiviral drugs approved by FDA to treat COVID-19. See  Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Q: Should angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) be stopped in patients with COVID-19? A: CDC is currently not aware of scientific evidence establishing a link between ACE-I or ARBs and risk of contracting or severity of COVID-19. The American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the American College of Cardiology  recommend external icon  continuation of ACE-I or ARB medications for all patients already prescribed those medications for indications such as heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease. Cardiovascular disease patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 should be fully evaluated by a healthcare professional before adding or removing any treatments, and any changes to their treatment should be based on the latest scientific evidence. Patients who rely on ACE-I or ARBs to treat chronic conditions and have additional questions should speak to their healthcare provider for individualized management. Q: Do nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) worsen the course of disease for people with COVID-19? A: CDC is currently not aware of scientific evidence establishing a link between NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and worsening of COVID19.  FDA external icon , the  European Medicines Agency external icon , the  World Health Organization , and CDC are continuing to monitor the situation and will review new information on the effects of NSAIDs and COVID-19 disease as it becomes available. For those who wish to use treatment options other than NSAIDs, there are other over-the-counter and prescription medications approved for pain relief and fever reduction. Patients who rely on NSAIDs to treat chronic conditions and have additional questions should speak to their healthcare provider for individualized management. Patients should use NSAIDs, and all medications, according to the product labels and advice of their healthcare professional. Q: What do waste management companies need to know about wastewater and sewage coming from a healthcare facility or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or person under investigation (PUI)?

Coronaviruses are susceptible to the same disinfection conditions in community and healthcare settings as other viruses, so current disinfection conditions in wastewater treatment facilities are expected to be sufficient. This includes conditions for practices such as oxidation with hypochlorite (i.e., chlorine bleach) and peracetic acid, as well as inactivation using UV irradiation. Q: Do wastewater and sewage workers need any additional protection when handling untreated waste from healthcare or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or PUI? A: Wastewater workers should use standard practices including basic hygiene precautions and wear the recommended PPE as prescribed for their current work tasks when handling untreated waste. There is no evidence to suggest that employees of wastewater plants need any additional protections in relation to COVID-19. Q: Should medical waste or general waste from healthcare facilities treating PUIs and patients with confirmed COVID-19 be handled any differently or need any additional disinfection? A: Medical waste (trash) coming from healthcare facilities treating COVID-2019 patients is no different than waste coming from facilities without COVID-19 patients.

Homeless services are often provided in congregate settings, which could facilitate the spread of infection. Because many people who are homeless are older adults or  have underlying medical conditions , they may also be at higher risk for severe disease than the general population. Health departments and healthcare facilities should be aware that people who are homeless are a particularly vulnerable group.

Many of the  recommendations to prevent COVID-19 may be difficult for a person experiencing homelessness to do. Although it may not be possible to avoid certain crowded locations (such as shelters), people who are homeless should try to avoid other crowded public settings and public transportation. If possible, they should use take-away options for food. As is true for everyone, they should maintain a distance of about 6 feet (two arms length) from other people. They also should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds as often as possible, and cover their coughs and sneezes. Any person experiencing homelessness with  symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) should alert their service providers (such as case managers, shelter staff, and other care providers).

If they meet  criteria for testing , people experiencing homelessness will access COVID-19 testing through a healthcare provider. Local public health and healthcare facilities need to determine the best location for this testing in coordination with homeless healthcare clinics and street medicine clinics. Those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should stay in a place where they can best be isolated from other people to prevent spreading the infection. Local health departments, housing authorities, homeless service systems and healthcare facilities should plan to identify locations to isolate those with known or suspected COVID-19 until they  meet the criteria to end isolation . Isolation housing could be units designated by local authorities or shelters determined to have capacity to sufficiently isolate these people. If no other options are available, homeless service providers should plan for how they can help people isolate themselves while efforts are underway to provide additional support.

El virus que causa la enfermedad del coronavirus2019, COVID-19, no es igual a los   coronavirus que circulan comnmente entre los seres humanos  y que causan enfermedades leves, como el resfriado comn. Un diagnstico de coronavirus229E, NL63, OC43 o HKU1 no es lo mismo que un diagnstico de COVID-19. Los pacientes con COVID-19 sern evaluados y atendidos de manera diferente a los pacientes con un diagnstico de coronavirus comn. El 11 de febrero del 2020, la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud  anunci   el nombre oficial de la enfermedad que est causando el brote del nuevo coronavirus2019 y que se identific por primera vez en Wuhan, China. El nuevo nombre de la enfermedad es enfermedad del coronavirus 2019, y su forma abreviada es COVID-19. En el COVID-19, \"CO\" corresponde a \"corona\", \"VI\" a \"virus\" y \"D\" a \"disease\" (enfermedad). Antes, la forma de referirse a esta enfermedad era \"nuevo coronavirus2019\" o \"2019-nCoV\". Existen  muchos tipos de coronavirus humanos, incluidos algunos que comnmente causan enfermedades leves en las vas respiratorias superiores. El COVID-19 es una nueva enfermedad, causada por un nuevo coronavirus que no se haba visto anteriormente en seres humanos. El nombre de esta enfermedad se eligi siguiendo las   mejores prcticas  cono de sitio externo  establecidas por la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud (OMS) para asignar nombres a nuevas enfermedades infecciosas en seres humanos. Es posible que las personas en los EE. UU. estn preocupadas o ansiosas por familiares y amigos que viven en lugares donde se est propagando elCOVID-19 o que estn visitando esas reas. Algunas personas estn preocupadas por la enfermedad. El temor y la ansiedad pueden conducir al estigma social, por ejemplo hacia chinos u otrosasiaticoamericanos o personas que estuvieron en cuarentena. El estigma consiste en discriminar a un grupo especfico de personas, un lugar o una nacin. El estigma est asociado a la falta de conocimiento acerca de cmo se propaga el COVID-19, la necesidad de culpar a alguien, el temor a las enfermedades y a la muerte, y a los chismes que fomentan rumores y mitos. El estigma perjudica a todo el mundo al generar ms temor y resentimiento contra personas comunes en vez de generarlo contra la enfermedad que est causando el problema. Las personas pueden combatir el estigma y ayudar a los dems, en vez de causarles dao, brindndolesapoyo social. Contrarreste el estigma informndose y difundiendo datos. Se puede ayudar a detener el estigma al difundir datos sobre el hecho de que los virus no atacan a determinados grupos raciales o tnicos e informacin sobre cmo se propaga realmente elCOVID-19.

Los coronavirus son una familia grande de virus. Algunos causan enfermedad en las personas y otros, como los coronavirus caninos y felinos, solo infectan a animales. En raras ocasiones,los coronavirus animales que infectan a los animales pueden evolucionar e infectar a las personas y luego propagarse de persona a persona.

Hay ms informacin sobre la fuente y la propagacin del COVID-19 disponible en el  Resumen de la situacin: fuente y propagacin del virus . Este virus se detect por primera vez en la ciudad de Wuhan, provincia de Hubei, China. Los primeros casos de infecciones estuvieron vinculados a un mercado de animales vivos, pero el virus ahora est propagndose de persona a persona. Cabe destacar que lapropagacin de persona a persona puede darse de forma continua. Algunos virus son altamente contagiosos(como el virus del sarampin), mientras que otros son menos contagiosos. Al parecer, el virus que causa el COVID-19 se est propagando fcilmente y de manera continua en la comunidad (\"propagacin en la comunidad\") en   ciertas reas geogrficas afectadas .

La  cantidad de casos de COVID-19  que se estn notificando en los Estados Unidos va en aumento porque  se incrementaron las pruebas de deteccin de laboratorio  y su notificacin en todo el pas. El nmero creciente de casos refleja en parte la rpida propagacin del COVID-19, ya que muchos estados y territorios estadounidenses alcanzaron la etapa de propagacin en la comunidad.

El virus que causa el COVID-19  seest propagando de persona a persona . Una persona que est activamente enferma con COVID-19 puede contagiar a los dems. Es por eso quelos CDC recomiendan que estos pacientes sean aislados en un hospital o en su hogar (dependiendo de la gravedad) hasta que estn mejor y ya no representen un riesgo de infeccin para los dems.

Adems, se deber tener en cuenta las caractersticas especficas de cada situacin, incluida la gravedad de la enfermedad, los signos y sntomas, y los resultados de las pruebas de laboratorio del paciente. Las  directrices actuales de los CDC acerca de cundo est bien permitirle a alguien salir del aislamiento se determinan segn cada caso en particular e incluyen el cumplimiento de todos los requisitos mencionados a continuacin: Se considera que la persona a la que se le permite salir del aislamiento no representa un riesgo de infeccin para losdems. Cuarentena significa separar a una persona o grupo de personas que han estado expuestas a una enfermedad contagiosa, pero que no han presentado la enfermedad (sntomas), de otras personas que no han estado expuestas, con el objetivo de prevenir la posible propagacin de esa enfermedad. La cuarentena generalmente se establece para el periodo de incubacin de la enfermedad transmisible, el cual es el periodo en el que las personas han manifestado la enfermedad despus de la exposicin. En el caso del COVID-19, el periodo de cuarentena es de14 das desde la ltima fecha de exposicin, ya que14 das es el periodo de incubacin ms largo que se ha observado en coronavirus similares. Se considera que la persona que cumple con la cuarentena por el COVID-19 no representa un riesgo de propagacin del virus porque durante el periodo de incubacin no present la enfermedad. Generalmente se cree que los coronavirus se propagan de persona a persona a travs de gotitas respiratorias. Actualmente no hay evidencia que respalde la transmisin del COVID-19 asociada a los alimentos. Siempre antes de preparar o de consumir alimentos es importante lavarse las manos con agua y jabn por20 segundos para preservar la seguridad de los alimentos en general. Durante el transcurso del da, hay que lavarse las manos despus de sonarse la nariz, toser o estornudar y despus de ir al bao. Podra ser posible que una persona contraiga el COVID-19 al tocar una superficie u objeto que tenga el virus y luego se toque la boca, la nariz o posiblemente los ojos, aunque no se cree que esta sea la principal forma en que se propaga el virus. Por lo general, debido a la poca capacidad de supervivencia de estos coronavirus en superficies, es probable que haya un riesgo muy bajo de propagacin a travs de los productos alimenticios o paquetes que son transportados congelados, refrigerados o a temperatura ambientepor periodos que duran varios das o semanas. Conozca lo que se sabe acerca de la  propagacin delCOVID-19 . An no se conoce con certeza si el clima y la temperatura inciden en la propagacin del COVID-19. Algunos virus, como los del resfriado comn o de la influenza (gripe), se propagan ms durante los meses fros, pero eso no significa que no sea posible enfermarse a causa de uno de esos virus durante otros meses. En este momento,no se sabe si la propagacin del COVID-19 se reducir con la llegada de temperaturas ms clidas. Hay mucho ms que aprender acerca de la transmisibilidad, gravedad y otras caractersticas asociadas al COVID-19, y las investigaciones estn en curso. La propagacin en la comunidad significa que las personas han sido infectadas por el virus en un rea, incluidas algunas personas que no saben con certeza cmo ni dnde se infectaron. Por lo general, los coronavirus sobreviven por periodos ms breves en temperaturas ms elevadas y condiciones de mayor humedad que en entornos ms fros o secos. No obstante, no tenemos datos directos acerca de este virus, ni tampoco tenemos datos directos sobre una temperatura lmite para la inactivacin en este momento.

Cuarentena significa separar a una persona o grupo de personas que han estado expuestas a una enfermedad contagiosa, pero que no han presentado la enfermedad (sntomas), de otras personas que no han estado expuestas, con el objetivo de prevenir la posible propagacin de esa enfermedad. La cuarentena generalmente se establece para el periodo de incubacin de la enfermedad transmisible, el cual es el periodo en el que las personas han manifestado la enfermedad despus de la exposicin. En el caso del COVID-19, el periodo de cuarentena es de14 das desde la ltima fecha de exposicin, ya que14 das es el periodo de incubacin ms largo que se ha observado en coronavirus similares. Se considera que la persona que cumple con la cuarentena por el COVID-19 no representa un riesgo de propagacin del virus porque durante el periodo de incubacin no present la enfermedad. Generalmente se cree que los coronavirus se propagan de persona a persona a travs de gotitas respiratorias. Actualmente no hay evidencia que respalde la transmisin del COVID-19 asociada a los alimentos. Siempre antes de preparar o de consumir alimentos es importante lavarse las manos con agua y jabn por20 segundos para preservar la seguridad de los alimentos en general. Durante el transcurso del da, hay que lavarse las manos despus de sonarse la nariz, toser o estornudar y despus de ir al bao. Podra ser posible que una persona contraiga el COVID-19 al tocar una superficie u objeto que tenga el virus y luego se toque la boca, la nariz o posiblemente los ojos, aunque no se cree que esta sea la principal forma en que se propaga el virus. Por lo general, debido a la poca capacidad de supervivencia de estos coronavirus en superficies, es probable que haya un riesgo muy bajo de propagacin a travs de los productos alimenticios o paquetes que son transportados congelados, refrigerados o a temperatura ambientepor periodos que duran varios das o semanas.

Algunos virus, como los del resfriado comn o de la influenza (gripe), se propagan ms durante los meses fros, pero eso no significa que no sea posible enfermarse a causa de uno de esos virus durante otros meses. En este momento,no se sabe si la propagacin del COVID-19 se reducir con la llegada de temperaturas ms clidas. Hay mucho ms que aprender acerca de la transmisibilidad, gravedad y otras caractersticas asociadas al COVID-19, y las investigaciones estn en curso. La propagacin en la comunidad significa que las personas han sido infectadas por el virus en un rea, incluidas algunas personas que no saben con certeza cmo ni dnde se infectaron. Por lo general, los coronavirus sobreviven por periodos ms breves en temperaturas ms elevadas y condiciones de mayor humedad que en entornos ms fros o secos. No obstante, no tenemos datos directos acerca de este virus, ni tampoco tenemos datos directos sobre una temperatura lmite para la inactivacin en este momento.

El COVID-19 es una enfermedad nueva y an estamos aprendiendo cmo se propaga.  Se cree que el virus que causa el COVID-19 se propaga principalmente a travs del contacto cercano (es decir,a una distancia de hasta aproximadamente 6 pies) con una persona que tenga en ese momento la enfermedad del coronavirus (COVID-19). El virus se propaga principalmente a travs de gotitas respiratorias que se producen cuando una persona infectada tose o estornuda, del mismo modo que se propagan la influenza y otrasinfecciones de las vas respiratorias. Estas gotitas pueden terminar en la boca o en la nariz de quienes se encuentran cerca o posiblemente ser inhaladas y llegar a los pulmones.Este tipo de propagacin no ocurre despus de que la persona haya muerto. Podra ser posible que una persona contraiga el COVID-19 al tocar una superficie u objeto que tenga el virus y luego se toque la boca, la nariz o posiblemente los ojos, aunque no se cree que esta sea la principal forma en que se propaga el virus. Las personas deberan considerar no tocar el cuerpo de alguien que muri a causa del COVID-19. Las personas mayores y las personas de todas las edades con afecciones graves subyacentes tienen un mayor riesgo de presentar un cuadro grave de COVID-19. Es posible que existan menos probabilidades de que el virus se propague a travs de ciertos tipos de contacto, como sostener la mano del difunto o darle un abrazo despus de que el cuerpo haya sido preparado para el velatorio. En lo posible, deberan evitarse otros tipos de actividades como besar, lavar y amortajar al difunto antes de que el cuerpo haya sido preparado, durante la preparacin y posteriormente. Si lavar el cuerpo o amortajar al difunto es una prctica cultural o religiosa importante, se recomienda a las familias que consulten con sus lderes religiosos o culturales de la comunidad y con el personal de la casa funeraria sobre cmo reducir su exposicin lo ms que se pueda. Como mnimo, las personas que realizan estas actividades deberan usar guantes desechables. Si existe la posibilidad de que se produzcan salpicaduras de lquidos corporales, es necesario usar un equipo de proteccin personal (EPP) adicional (como bata,protector facial o gafas de proteccin ymascarilla desechables). La limpieza debera realizarse siguiendo las instrucciones del fabricante de cada producto de limpieza y desinfeccin (p. ej., concentracin, mtodo de aplicacin y tiempo de contacto, etc.).  Se anticipa que los productos aprobados por la EPA que afirman ser eficaces contra patgenos virales emergentes cono de pdf cono de sitio externo   sern eficaces contra elCOVID-19, con base en los datos de virus ms difciles de eliminar Despus de quitarse el EPP, es necesario realizar  la higiene de manos  que consiste en lavarse las manos con agua y jabn durante 20 segundos como mnimo o usar un desinfectante de manos a base de alcohol que contenga al menos un 60% de alcohol en caso de que no se disponga de agua y jabn. Se debe usar agua y jabn si las manos estn visiblemente sucias. Se puede realizar un funeral o velatorio de alguien que muri a causa del COVID-19. Los trabajadores de funerarias deben cumplir con las precauciones de rutina para el control y la prevencin de infecciones cuando manipulen el cuerpo de una persona que falleci por COVID-19. Si es necesario poner un cuerpo en una bolsa mortuoria, tome las   precauciones estndares , incluido el uso de equipo de proteccin personal (EPP) adicional en caso de que se prevean salpicaduras de lquidos corporales. Para trasladar un cadver despus de que el cuerpo haya sido introducido en la bolsa mortuoria, desinfecte la parte exterior de la bolsa con un  producto aprobado por la EPA que afirme ser eficaz contra patgenos virales emergentes  cono de pdf cono de sitio externo y que se anticipa que ser eficaz contra elCOVID-19 segn los datos disponibles para virusmsdifciles de matar. Siga las instrucciones del fabricante para cada uno de los productos de limpieza y desinfeccin (p. ej., concentracin, mtodo de aplicacin y tiempo de contacto, etc.). Useguantes desechables de nitrilo para manipular la bolsa mortuoria. Puede realizarse el embalsamamiento del cuerpo. Durante el embalsamamiento, tome las precauciones estndares que incluyen el uso de EPP adicional en caso de que haya salpicaduras (p. ej., protector facial o gafas de proteccin, bata ymascarilla desechables). Utilice la proteccin respiratoria adecuada si alguno de los procedimientos generar aerosoles o si se indica en la etiqueta del fabricante del producto qumico que se usar.
